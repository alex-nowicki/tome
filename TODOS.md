# Project

- [ ] Instead of a tab for collections, include a view options that collects articles into collections, use the sort select
- [ ] Remove stories from the articles list

# Timeline

- [ ] Implement expand and back to top buttons

# Stories

- [ ] Create a story layout (fence it off?)

# Collections

- [ ] What purpose does it serve?
    - Useful in link highlighting, as the category is highlighted and sends to a list of relevant articles: https://tome.nowickidesign.com/garuda/things/wildnet/


# Articles

- [ ] Prevent link highlighting inside of info preview: https://tome.nowickidesign.com/garuda/things/ekho-drones/
- [ ] Adjust styling of lists: https://tome.nowickidesign.com/garuda/things/locknet/
- [ ] Not sure if I implemented the label object across all collections: https://tome.nowickidesign.com/garuda/events/first-contact/
- [ ] Rethink relationship field for Group Connections: https://tome.nowickidesign.com/garuda/groups/frontier-logistics/
- [ ] Weird spacing for related articles: https://tome.nowickidesign.com/garuda/groups/frontier-logistics/
- [ ] Add a collections tag to each article
- [ ] Redesign the nav list
- [ ] Cap the number of articles per list in the side nav, add a show all button that takes you to the article list, shown articles should be sorted by most recent, maybe change 'show' to 'show recent'

// TODO - Tweak content spacing and add different content types for testing
