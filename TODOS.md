# Project


# Timeline

- [] Implement expand and back to top buttons

# Stories

- [] Create a story layout (fence it off?), Maybe see if you can use the netlify authentication on it?

# Collections

- [] What purpose does it serve?
    - Useful in link highlighting, as the category is highlighted and sends to a list of relevant articles: https://tome.nowickidesign.com/garuda/things/wildnet/
- [] Remove collections from Card Group


# Articles

- [] Prevent link highlighting inside of info preview: https://tome.nowickidesign.com/garuda/things/ekho-drones/
- [] Adjust styling of lists: https://tome.nowickidesign.com/garuda/things/locknet/
- [] Tweak content spacing and add different content types for testing


# Side Panel
- [] Set up a regular and small view all button styles
- [] Need to add an active state to current article and make sure that current article is included in side panel regardless of recent edit? (Maybe that's redundant), would it make more sense to exclude current article?
