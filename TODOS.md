# Home



# Project

- [] Instead of a tab for collections, include a view options that collects articles into collections, use the sort select
- [] Remove stories from the articles list

# Timeline

- [] Implement expand and back to top buttons

# Stories

- [] Create a story layout (fence it off?), Maybe see if you can use the netlify authentication on it?

# Collections

- [] What purpose does it serve?
    - Useful in link highlighting, as the category is highlighted and sends to a list of relevant articles: https://tome.nowickidesign.com/garuda/things/wildnet/
- [] Fix Card Group component to account for collections no longer being included?


# Articles

- [] Prevent link highlighting inside of info preview: https://tome.nowickidesign.com/garuda/things/ekho-drones/
- [] Adjust styling of lists: https://tome.nowickidesign.com/garuda/things/locknet/
- [] Add a collections tag to each article
- [] Tweak content spacing and add different content types for testing
- [] Convert existing md files to the new details widget 


# Side Panel
- [] Add right arrow to Show All Articles links in sidepanel
- [] Need to add an active state to current article and make sure that current article is included in side panel regardless of recent edit? (Maybe that's redundant), would it make more sense to exclude current article?
- [] Maybe a header with 'Recently Updated Article' might be clearer to add above the sidepanel
