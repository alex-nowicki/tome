## Narrow AI

AI that is trained to do a very specific task and will perform that task to the quality of its training. These are relatively ubiquitous, controlling drones, managing networks, etc. While it is possible for them to hallucinate, it is much rarer than in the case of Adaptives.

## Adaptive AI

AI that learns from its environments and changes its behaviour accordingly. Adaptive AIs are given a task to complete and will do whatever is necessary to achieve it. Adaptives are usually used for short term tasks, as the longer they exist, the more likely that they go off script, potentially changing their core function. There are many cases of collateral damage, as Humans are incapable of predicting every banned course of action the AI may use before hand. Adaptives are most often used as weapons and spies.

## Hallucinations

All AIs of a sufficient complexity suffer from hallucinations. These are moments where the AI acts in unexpected ways. No one really understands what causes the hallucination and there are no solutions. As such, AIs are not widely adopted. A few spectacular failures have made them too risky to place in control of important systems, but some groups use them anyway as they are cheaper than labour.
