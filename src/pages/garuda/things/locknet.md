## Authentication

There are many ways to authenticate a user for a LockNet:

* Corporations mostly use chipping, where a tamper proof ID chip is embedded into the user.
* Strays use a physical connection to authenticate users. If anything strange is detected in the behaviour of the user, the connection is automatically severed and must be renewed in person by a network admin.
