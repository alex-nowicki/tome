Alien technology that enables FTL interstellar travel. The Mirror Gates are operated by the enigmatic alien AI known as the Gatekeeper. The size of the network is unknown. The Gatekeeper restricts humanity’s expansion to a dozen habitable systems until they are deemed ready to meet other galactic species. 

Gate assemblies are “slingshot” with a similar technology as the Gravity Tether (but with speed faster than humans can currently achieve) from one star system to another. Once the assembly arrives, it harvests asteroids to construct a gate. 

Little is known of how the Gates work or who built them, as the Gates are impossible to scan and study. There are also rumours that the Gatekeeper actively suppresses any knowledge that might lead to the construction of the gates.
