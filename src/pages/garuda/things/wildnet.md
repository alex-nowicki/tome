An open network between the first fleet of colony ships during their voyage to Alpha Centauri, the WildNet only received its common name long after landfall. As the necessity for cooperation waned after the initial settling of the Prosper system, corporations established their own closed networks for employees and owners, forgoing any protection they once offered it.

AIs run rampant, mining user information, stealing data and burrowing into connected systems. Presently, the WildNet is mainly used by the poor, criminals, and activists, including the Cloud Heads who have carved their own territory in it called the Garden.

## Timed Drop

The safest way to transmit data on the WildNet is a timed drop. The sender sends the receiver a time and place in the WildNet. The sender than drops the data for a fraction of a second at the appointed time, deleting it immediately after. It is very difficult to intercept a timed drop, without knowing at least the location of the drop.

## Stalker AIs

Since the WildNet is hosted in a patchwork of unverifiable servers, criminals and corporations have AIs that spy, collect and sabotage users. It is incredibly risky to access the WildNet from a personal device and without any forms of protection.

## The Walled Garden

A section of the WildNet moderated by the Cloudheads. It is considered the only safe place to share data or do business on the WildNet. Access is only granted to users that contribute to the Walled Garden, usually by donation server space.
