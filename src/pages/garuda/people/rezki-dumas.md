## History

Born to religious parents, Pilgrims of the Hidden Path, a religion that believes the Gate Keeper is shepherding the faithful to paradise.

When the Gatekeeper gifted new planets to humanity, his parents packed their things and took off to join one of many communes popping up on the Frontier, hoping to escape the persecution and fulfill the gatekeepers plan for them.

Rezki was a teenager, already rebellious, bored and using his vast intelligence to make and sell drugs. When they arrive at the commune and Rezki is faced with controlling and conservative community, he turns to his old tricks, making drugs and selling them to those seeking escape.

Rezki's younger sister was chosen as a bride to the commune elder, so Rezki hatches a plan to save her and escape off planet. He poisons much of the commune and takes off with his sister, but she gets cold feet and refuses to leave with him. He hasn't seen her since.
