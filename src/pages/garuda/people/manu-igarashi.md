## History

Worked in a shipyard for many years. One day, a work accident destroyed his retinas leaving him blind. His company refused to pay for treatment because he was too old. He was let go. His children took him in, though like him, they are not well off and the financial burden of looking after him was large. He spent the next year training his ferrets to act as his eyes, hoping to get his job back and provide again. He applied for jobs everywhere, stating that with the ferrets he could do the job as well as anyone else. No one would take him, his kids tried to convince him to retire. He worked enough and they could look after him. Manu could not bear the idea of being a burden on his kids, so he took up one day and left, looking for work on the space port. He ended up on the Garuda.

He is a proud member of the Uplift Society, a group of individuals dedicated to the evolution of intelligent non-human species. Manu is a ferret expert and has raised them since he was in his 30s. His fesnyng are very intelligent and help him navigate without sight, aid in mechanical repairs and can even communicate simple thoughts and feelings.
