## History
Mother is a scam artist who stole their family’s savings when the police closed in and ran off when he was young, leaving them in poverty and debt. He learned that you can’t trust anyone, even family, and that everything can be taken away, unless you take it first.

Father is a kindly man, working a mindless job, day in and day out. Loving and doting, Bopha resents how he lets people walk all over him. His father sold his brain and served as an Echo to help pay off the debt.

Sister is the responsible one, working up the corporate ladder, still paying off the family debt. She does not approve of what he does for a living and resents him for leaving her to look after their father. Her daughter is Chantico De La Rosa.
