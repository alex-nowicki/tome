## History

Heiress to the Niska Corporation, Snow was raised in an ivory tower with absent parents. Her entire childhood was spent grooming her to take over the family business. She resents her parents callousness and lack of compassion, vowing to end the capitalistic society they represent. Her bodyguard Zambaga became her surrogate parent, teaching her how to defend herself and feeling the void of love in her life.
