Created by a technologically advanced race of isolationist aliens over 500,000 years ago. Its purpose is to control the growth of intelligent space faring species within reach of its creators, as well as gather information about their cultures and technology.

Aggressive species are curtailed, and if they pose an existential threat, they are destroyed or sabotaged.

The Gatekeeper maintains that is is neutral to the species it interacts with, but it does interfere with the development of certain technologies deemed threatening to its creators.

## Facets

The Gatekeeper's intelligence is divided into Facets, one for every species it encounters. These Facets are seperate from the central mind of the AI, existing as a kind of child.

Their purpose is two-fold, one to better communicate and build trust with the species, but also to better understand its way of thinking. They are simulations of the brain construction of the species, meaning they will react as a human would. It uses all humans that pass through it to build an average personality. This personality changes with every transit, but minutely so.
