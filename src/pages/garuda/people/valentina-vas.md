## History

Valentina grew up on Prosper, best friends with Bopha. Together they hatch a plan to steal a star ship to escape their home make it as Strays on the Frontier. They manage to steal the ship, but Valentina is infected with a anti-theft pathogen. The pathogen means she can no longer set foot on an exchange world without notifying the authorities. She is immuno-compromised from the drugs she takes to suppress the pathogen.
