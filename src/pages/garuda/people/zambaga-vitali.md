## History

Highly skilled soldier in Snow’s parent security force. Handpicked when Snow was 5 years old to protect her 24/7. At first, she resented the job, but the pay was better than anything she would receive as a soldier. Never picturing herself as a mother, she surprised herself by falling in love with Snow and becoming a surrogate mother to her, filling the void of her mostly absent parents.

She swore an oath to Snow when she was a child to only use non-lethal weaponry in her protection. As such, she’s developed many innovative weapons.
