## History

Marikit Khadira was a brilliant biologist/geneticist and original settler. While working on the planet of Rahim, she saw the harm their instrusion in the ecosystem was causing and thought it would be better to change the human instead of the world. She started experimenting on herself in secret, eventually revealing her work by boldly breathing the poisoned air of Rahim. Her employers were interested in the science, but not the philosophy, hoping to use her new genetic techniques to prolong life.



## Tahawwul

The process of genetic self-transmutation pioneered by Khadira.

## Precepts

* Tahawwul shall never be done to an unborn child or a pregnant mother.
* Tahawwul shall never be done to the brain.
* Tahawwul shall never be done to prolong life beyond its natural limit.
