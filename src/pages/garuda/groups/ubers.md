A person born with an optimized human genetic code. While the procedure itself is cheap, all the useful segments are patented and require a heavy licensing fee, so it is mostly the very wealthy who are able to offer it to their children.

What was once a mark of status, flaunted with flamboyant edits like purple eyes, or patterned skin, has with the growing Uncut movement led to Ubers preferring more subtle, easily concealed edits.
