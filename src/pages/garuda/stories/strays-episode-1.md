# Strays: Episode 1

## Chapter 1

Bopha Krol smiles at the two chumps across the table from him. He can tell by the childlike wonder in their eyes that he’s got them hook, line and sinker. That last round of Khuyen’s homebrew must have knocked out the few remaining neurons between them, because they’re hanging off of his every word. The yarn he spins is so well worn that the words come pouring out, each honed to ensnare the sheltered and naive corporate brats that flood Khuyen’s Den every year. Straight out of school, they fly in on spotless spaceships bought with their parent’s credits, thinking they’ve got what it takes to be Strays. These two won’t last a week, especially if they’re stupid enough go chasing his tall tale.

“So where is it?” Blue Eyes whispers, hunched over the table like the regulars sitting behind him haven’t heard it a hundred times. His hair is annoyingly perfect, blond locks frozen as if in a sea breeze. The hair cut probably costs more than Bopha’s business makes in a month.

“If it weren’t for me being marooned here without a ship, I’d be collecting that loot myself you see. But fortune being what it is, I’m stuck here. I’ll tell you what, you help me get back on my feet and I’ll give you the coordinates, with a modest percentage of course.”

Their eyes light up. Nothing like a business deal to get a corporate brat’s rocks hard. Blue Eyes leans back and whispers to his partner, who’s been trying for the last five minutes to keep his eyes on Bopha, the room must be spinning something fierce.

“5,000 credits and 5% of whatever we find.”

Bopha smiles, he picked the right idiots this time, “12,000, 20%”

“We’re doing all the work old man, 8,000, 8%”

Bopha purses his lips and sucks in some air, rubbing his patchy beard, “9,000, 9%, final offer.”

Blue Eyes shoots his hand out, “Deal.”

Bopha grips his hand and shakes it, “Deal”. Their Qs link and make the deal official, exchanging credits for phony coordinates.

“Pleasure doing business.” Bopha smiles, “Though, if I were you, I’d set off soon. The Frontier’s not as empty as it used to be. Things aren’t lost for long anymore.”

The chumps nearly jump out of their seats, Bopha a little jealous of their innocent excitement. He watches them stumble out of the Den, Blue Eyes tugging at the other’s jacket to stop him from keeling over.

He scans the room, recognizing some other Strays he’s worked with in the past, but all make sure to avoid eye contact, back turned towards him. He takes another draught of beer and curses them all. Ever since Khuyen stripped him off the Roster, they’ve avoided him like the plague. The Roster fills an entire wall of the bar, ship crests of all Strays in good standing mounted one next to the other. The empty space where the Garuda’s crest should be draws his eye like a black hole. 

It was one the proudest days of his life, when he hoisted it up onto the wall. He should have known that the universe would eventually shit on his dream like it has his entire life. It feels like a lifetime ago, when he and Val first rolled up in their new ship, eager to make names for themselves, to find a place to call home outside of the Exchange. Everything seemed possible back then. The Gatekeeper had just offered humanity two new star systems to call their own, new worlds unspoiled by the megacorps. Dreamers of all kinds made their way out to the Frontier to build colonies, to explore, and the Strays were the glue that made it all work. Bopha looks around the bar, and sees only a shadow of its former self. No dreamers left here, unless you count the corporate brats playing out their fantasy gap years. Little by little the megacorps bought and stole everything and everyone, leaving only a few standouts hanging on by a thread. Bopha takes another swig, noticing that he’s emptied it already. He glances over at the door to Old Lady's office, reminding himself why he’s here in the first place. But the thought of bending over backwards and begging for a handout makes his stomach turn. He’s never begged his whole life and he doesn’t plan on starting now. He’s 9,000 credits richer than he was a few minutes ago, but that's just tiny drop in the bucket for what he needs for Val's treatment, not to mention fuel, food and crew wages. If he's good at anything, it's procrastinating. He promises himself to head over there after just one more brew. He flicks an order on the embedded slate, watching a few more credits disappear from his account.

While he waits, Bopha rolls up his right sleeve, taking a deep breath and willing his janky arm lock bracer to open. It takes a couple tries for the outdated tech to register his heart rate and adrenal activity as safe. He’s been meaning to get a new one for a while, but credits seem to vanish just as quickly as they come these days. The bracer slides open, revealing a half dozen slots, implanted directly into his arm, a thick vein of high bandwidth cable snaking up and under his arm all the way to his spine. He pulls out the burner Q he uses for his less than honest business deals and fishes his real one out of his pocket, slotting it back in place. Crisp white lines paint across his retinas, loading up his custom interface. Three unread messages, blink a soft red in the bottom right of his vision. 

He opens the first, <Val: You meet with her yet?>

And the second, <Val: You better not be just sitting and getting drunk.>

And the third, <Val: Bopha, you can't avoid her forever.>

Bopha rolls his eyes. He loves Val more than he does his real sister, but sometimes he wishes she wouldn't nag him like one.

He dismisses the notifications and instead subvocalizes an encrypted message, attaching info on the two chumps. He hesitates on the last word, but bites his lip and sends it { another fish for your net, saamnap }.

A few seconds later, { you’ll get the usual if they show up }.

Bopha’s heart sinks. Not that he was expecting much, but her message is all business. He starts composing a reply when Valentina sits down across from him, the old printed leather booth creaking as she slides in.

“Don’t do it Bopha.” The words come out a little fast. Each timed to the beat of her foot tapping against the floor. She's got her metronome cranked up, which means one of two things, she's busy working on a project or she's pissed. Bopha doesn't need to ask to know which one she is right now.

“Don’t do what?” 

Valentina tilts her head, and frowns like you would at puppy caught eating out of the trash. “Don’t send that reply.”

“Were you reading my lips? I told you I don’t like that.”

“You never minded me doing it to a mark.”

“Well that’s different isn’t it.” Bopha looks away, gazing off across the dimly lit Den. It’s busier than usual for this time, but then again, more and more Strays are struggling to get work, so where the hell else are you going to spend your time. A silence sets over the table. Bopha notices the soft thump of Val's tapping slowing down slightly.

Val breaks the silence first, “She’s bad news Bopha.”

Bopha looks back at her, counting the blinks, so perfectly synced to her metronome. Val is the closest friend he's ever had. But like all close friends, they always think they know your life best.

“We’re not doing this again Val.”

“She’s trouble and we don’t need trouble right now.” The swagger of her diction mimicking that of her favourite shred-hop group.

For the thousandth time Bopha bites back telling her that without Desiree, Val wouldn’t even be here talking to him. “This has nothing to do with we? Alright? Let it go.”

“Fine."

She looks down at the empty pints littering the table, “So either you met with Khuyen and it went terribly, or you chickened out and you're here hiding behind a wall of glass. Which is it?”

As much as he cherishes their friendship, right now, he really wishes she would just fuck off. “Working my way over there.”

“Bopha. You’ve been here for hours.”

“I know, I know.”

A bar drone rolls its way to the table, a tray of drinks clinking and sloshing. It claws one and serves to Bopha, but before he can grab it, Val steals it away. “Nope, you’ve had enough.”

“Oh come on Val.”

“We need work, Bopha. Scamming teens out of some cash isn’t going to pay the bills. So swallow that stupid pride of yours and make up with Khuyen.”

“It’s not that easy.”

“Bopha, we had one bad job… a spectacularly bad job, but either way, Khuyen would have chewed us out and moved on if it weren't for your ego.”

Bopha remembers the exchange well, and no amount of ass kissing would have smoothed over the Old Lady’s fury. Granted, some of the choice words he called her probably didn’t help. “We don’t need her Val, we became Strays to get away from having to owe our livelihoods to someone else.”

Val reaches across the table and grabs his hand. He feels the pulse of the metronome through her fingers, gently pressing with the ubiquitous beat. “Bopha, that was then, this is now. The Frontier’s changing and we need to change with it. Can you do that for–”

Val’s whole body just freezes, the top tapping stopping, the gentle presses gone from her hand. Bopha blood turns to ice as reaches across and shakes her shoulder. “Val, Val, come on, snap out of it.”

Suddenly, the spell breaks and she gasps for air, drawing in a dozen quick breaths before slowing down to a regular rhythm.

“Are you alright?”

She nods tentatively.

Bopha's heart is beating a mile a minute. The doc said the seizures would come back, but he figured they had more time, she'd been doing so well since the last treatment. 

"Don't look at me like that." 

He can see the panic in her eyes, even though she's doing her best to hide it. "Val-"

She holds up her hand to dismiss it, "We knew it would happen again. And it did. I'm not going to stop living my life because my brain is fucked. I've lived my whole life with it. Nothing's changed."

Everything's changed. Bopha knows it. He knew it the moment the seizures started a few months ago, Val barely clinging to life in the med bay while they raced across the system to find a doctor who would treat her and keep her secret. The treatment worked but the price was steep. Steeper than anything Bopha could muster from the odd jobs Khuyen threw their way. So he reached out to Desiree and she made him an offer. He blew up the frigate and their spot on the roster. He promised that would be it, but what other options does he have? The doc recommended an off the books specialist who could properly remove the device burrowed in her brain, but his fee makes the doctor's look like parking change. He hoped he'd have more time to get the credits.

"Val, we need to talk about this."

"We have, we've gone through the options. It is what it is."

"Not all of them. We could sell the Garuda."

Val's eyebrows shoot up, a rare expression of surprise for her normally steely face. "No."

"Let's just think about it."

"No Bopha. There's nothing to think about. The Garuda's our home. If I'm going to die, I want to die there."

A tear escapes down Val's cheek, she quickly wipes it away, doubling down on a tough stare to mask it.

"Alright. Okay. It's off the table."

She nods. 

"You should go see Arooj so she can run some tests." She waves his words away like an annoying fly.

"You need to see Khuyen and I'm not leaving until you do." She crosses her arms and settles in. Val's one of the toughest people he knows, and one of the most stubborn. She would die right there, in that shitty old booth just to prove a point.

“Okay, I’m going.” Bopha stands up from the table, feeling the homebrew a little more than he expected. 

“Don't fuck this up Bopha.”

Bopha puts on a grin, touching his chest in fake affront, “Me? Everybody loves me.”

A small smile creeps onto her face, "If that were true, we'd be a lot richer." She stands up from the table, taking it slow, testing her balance. Bopha suppresses the desire to help her out, knowing she'd hate him for it.

"I'm locking you out of the Garuda until you talk to her, so don't get lost on the way there."

Bopha watches her walk off the smile fading from his face. He takes a deep breath and then makes his way through the loose crowd of drunkards. He reaches the back wall of the bar, where two overly Threaded brutes guard the door to the back.

“Mateo! Reina!”

“Well if it ain't Bopha, Captain of the Garuda. Haven’t seen you in a while. Figured a creditor finally impounded your ship.” Reina’s stone-like face doesn’t betray a single emotion.

“They got to catch me first right.” Bopha grins.

Mateo laughs and Bopha braces himself just in time to not get knocked over by the meaty hand smacking him on the shoulder. “I miss our banter Bopha. You must come visit next time you’re on station.”

“I nearly died last time we hung out Mateo, I still have a scar from Reina’s garbage aim.” Bopha holds up his left hand, a round scar in the meat between the thumb and index.

“Next time, I’ll make sure to hit something a little more valuable.” Reina shoots back, the corner of her mouth betraying a grin.

“So is the Old Lady out back?”

Mateo’s smile vanishes, “You know she doesn’t like being called that and she was pretty clear last time that she never wanted to see your… How did she put it?”

“Garbage ass face.”

“Right. … never wanted to see your garbage ass face again.”

“Look, I really need to talk with her. I’m here to patch things up.”

“I don’t know, Bopha. You know we both like you, but Khuyen’s word is law here.”

Bopha sighs, “Okay, I didn’t want to have to do this, but Reina if you don’t let me in, I’m going to tell Mateo your little secret.”

Reina’s eyes nearly pop out of their skull. “Bopha, you say a word and I will cut you into tiny pieces and flush you down the toilet.”

Bopha gulps at that very vivid image, but holds his ground.

“What secret?” Mateo has his arms crossed facing off against Reina.

“Mateo, it’s nothing alright.”

“It’s obviously not nothing, is it? Since when do you not tell me absolutely everything?”

“Mateo, don’t be such a baby alright?”

“Baby? Are you calling me a baby?” He puffs his chest out, fists clenching.

“Yeah, you’re definitely acting like one right now.” Reina squares off.

Mateo snorts and launches at his sister, grappling her with augmented threaded muscles. She counters tussling him to the ground. While they grunt and roll around on the ground, flipping tables as they go, Bopha sneaks into the back room, hoping they’ll be still busy by the time he gets back.

Bopha walks through into the back, large stainless steel vats filling every available space, pipes running in a tangle above and below. Nestled between two of the vats is a large desk with a short gray haired woman standing precariously on it, one bright yellow flip flop held high in the air. Bopha walks up to her, just as she winds her hand back, aiming for something on the vat behind her.

“Khuyen!”

She swings and misses, a fly escaping. “God dammit. Who’s the fucking idiot?” She turns around on the desk, still clutching her flip flop in one hand. “Bopha Krol. Why don’t you come a bit closer so I can at least squash one bug today.”

“It’s nice to see you too.” Bopha walks over and offers a hand. “Let me help you down.”

She smacks his hand with the flip flop, “You think I didn’t hear you calling me the Old Lady outside.”

Bopha winces, “Just a term of endearment.” 

Khuyen sprightly steps down onto her chair and back to the floor. “Is that so?” She fixes him with a sharp gaze. She would have made an excellent principal, or investigator.

“So what brings the unreliable captain of the Garuda to my office. Uninvited, I might add.”

“I thought we should catch up and work things out.”

“Quit the bullshit Bopha. You’re broke and you need work.”

“I guess that’s one way of putting it.”

“Well step in line. With the fucking Megacorps expanding into the Frontier, free contracts are getting harder and harder to come by.” Bopha hears the buzzing of the fly next to his head, he swats the air, “And frankly, even if I did have something, why should I send it your way? I made it pretty darn clearly I never wanted to see your–”

“–Garbage ass face again, yes I remember.”

Khuyen scowls at him.

“Khuyen, are you really still upset about the last job?”

“Upset? You blew up a frigate!”

“I didn’t blow it up, it blew itself up.” Bopha lies, “We patched that sorry excuse for a reactor long enough to get the crew to safety. Could’ve been a lot–”

Khuyen’s flip flop slams down on the table, “Got ya you piece of shit!” She flips her sandal over and flicks off the twitching fly. “Bopha. My business is credibility. I guarantee the work that I pass on. When the job blows up, my credibility suffers. You were unreliable even before you blew up that frigate. You’re in the business of fixing emergencies, not making them.”

“Okay, I’ll admit, I’ve had a string of bad luck recently, but you know I’ve got the fastest ship and the best crew.”

“Don’t be stupid, there’s a dozen Strays out there with a better crew then yours.”

“But I do have the fastest ship.” 

“Quick and useless is still useless.”

“Khuyen. I’m asking you to give me another chance.”

Khuyen’s eyebrow raises a little. “Are you asking or begging?”

Bopha clenches his jaw, holding back the wave of anger building up.

“Bopha Krol, the Captain who has an answer for everything, is silent now.” She leans forward, a shark-like grin on her face, “Are you begging?”

“Yes.” He forces the word out of his mouth, every muscle in his face fighting it.

"I want to hear you say it."

Bopha has a mind to snatch the flip flop and beat her over the head with it, but he the image of Val freezing at the table calms him, centers his mind to what's important.

"I'm begging you." He tried his best to inflect the words with the most defiance possible, but it just comes out petulant.

Khuyen smiles. “It’s nice to know that even you can swallow that overblown pride. I might have something for a fast ship. Before you get excited. It’s a shit contract. I’ve already had three Strays refuse it. The pay is low, and the client is, well, strange. And there’s a catch.”

“There always is, isn’t there? What is it?”

“Contract stipulates you take on two new crewmembers.”

Bopha shakes his head vigorously, “That’s not how Strays work.”

“As I said, it’s a shit contract. But it is a job, and it pays. So what will it be? Your pride or your work?” 

Bopha knows he has no choice. If he wants to help Val, he needs the credits, though by the sounds of it, it won’t even cover their expenses. But if he can get the Garuda back on the roster, maybe there’s something. It feels like a fool's hope, but it’s all he’s got.

“Alright, I’ll take it, but you put the Garuda back on the Roster.”

“Three months. If you can do this job for three months without killing anyone or blowing something up, consider yourself back in my good standing.” 
Bopha stands up and offers his hand, “Deal.”

Khuyen stands, but crosses her arms, “Also, my cut is double.”

“Double?” Bopha tries very hard to not start listing those choice words again.

“Consider it insurance.”

Bopha takes a breath, trying to calm himself down, keeping his eye on the prize. “Fine.”

They shake hands, their Qs exchanging info.

“The Interstellar Rescue Agency? Why does that sound familiar?”

“Just get the hell out of my office before I come to my senses.”

“Always a pleasure,” Bopha packs as much sarcasm as he can into those three words, and just because he can’t help himself, “... Old Lady.” 
“I’m going to pretend I didn’t hear that. Don’t fuck this up.”

"Why does everyone keep saying that?" Bopha hurries out of the back room, hoping to not get clobbered by the jacked up siblings at the door.

## Chapter 2

Bopha steps through the airlock into the Garuda. The absence of the smell of stale homebrew is jarring, like walking into a forest glade after a three day bender. He kicks off his shoes and stores them in the locker, slapping his sandals down and slipping his feet in. He wiggles his toes and breathes out, it’s nice to be home. That little moment of peace is promptly shattered, when Rezki stumbles into the airlock, sporting only his underwear, body covered in hundreds of brightly coloured eyes. Paint is dripping from his fingers onto the floor. He looks like a toddler's canvas, most of the eyes malformed and smudged copies of the Pilgrim's tattoo on his forehead of two interlocking circles with an eye in the overlap. 

"Rezki! You're getting paint all over the floor." Bopha exhales the words, no real fight in him, long resigned to the fact that while his crew are brilliant at what they do, there's a reason why they work for him for low wages and negligible prospects. Who else would put up with this shit?

Rezki turns to Bopha, squinting as if he were small insect he hadn't noticed till now, "You shouldn't be here little bird. The path is long and you will lose yourself."

Through Rezki's sweaty long hair, Bopha can see that his eyes are black orbs, the pupils fully dilated. His breath smells of soil and rosemary, side effects of whatever narcotic concoction he's invented this time. 

"Rezki, we fucking talked about this. If you want to get stoned and search for the meaning of whatever, you do it in your cabin, no dripping this shit all over the ship." 

Rezki fixes him with a very serious stare, "I know. I too seek the Hidden Path little bird."

"I swear to god Rezki, if you call me little bird again-"

Rezki turns suddenly and walks back out of the airlock into the ship, "It's this way, yes, this way..." Muttering to himself as he disappears down the passageway, "Come little bird."

Bopha takes a deep breath and sighs, starring at the paint drying on the floor. "I need a beer." 

He walks out of the airlock, careful to not get any paint on his sandals and makes his way to the messhall. There he's greeted by a cacophony of sounds erupting from the kitchen, a jumble of clanging pots, sizzling oil, squeaks and an overwhelmed Manu, barking orders. The ship’s MechTech is stirring a frying pan with one hand, chunks of mushrooms flying out of it, as a fesnyng of ferrets scamper all over the kitchen, chirping and whistling alarmingly, trying to direct the blind chef’s movements. A red sauce is bubbling angrily nearby, spraying the wall with specks of tomato.

Bopha shakes his head. From one mess to another. The old man has taken to cooking recently, after Chantico complained about the taste of their rations. The man is an excellent mechanic, blind or not, but his pathological need to be helpful rarely ends up being anything near helpful. Smoke starts to seep from the oven. One of the ferrets barks wildly.

“Bugger,” Manu drops the frying pan on the stove top, as the ferret on his shoulder whistles direction into his ear. With the grace of a sighted man, he throws the oven open and grips the casserole dish with both hands, unphased by the heat, throwing it on the stove top, smashing into the sauce pot, sloshing a wave of sauce against the wall.

“Made a right bung job of it, eh mokos?” One of the ferrets notices Bopha, and squawks. Bopha recognises the distinctive white stripe down its spine. That little shit, Hokori. Bopha gives it the stink eye, and it sticks its tongue out, turns around and waves its asshole at him.

“Captain,” Manu quickly rubs his big calloused hands on his apron and smiles directly at Bopha, sidestepping in front of the stove, he can only imagine to hide the absolute disaster unfolding. One of the ferrets scampers onto the counter and switches off all the induction magnets.

“What’s cooking Manu?”

“Just figured the crew needed a hearty meal to get morale up.”

“That’s very kind, as always. You know, you don’t have to–”

“Not a problem at all boss, just saw a need and got it done.”

Bopha looks over the kitchen, “Sure did. Well, I’ll leave you to it, just going to grab a beer.”

“Oh, I can get you one, you stay right there.”

“Manu, it’s fine.”

“No, no, no, I got it.” Manu spins around, the apron tied around his large belly catching on the frying pan, nearly dragging it off the stove. The ferrets marshall quickly, pulling it out of the snag before it can drop. “Oh, nearly lost it there.” He chuckles, his grizzled cheeks turning red. He skips over to the fridge and plucks out a pouch of beer, bringing it over.

“Thanks Manu,” Bopha takes the pouch, feeling the sticky red sauce all over it.

“Anything you need, you let me know, boss.”

“Will do,” Bopha turns tail, but not before giving the finger to Hokori, who hisses in return.

Bopha wipes his hand on a nearby towel and pops in the straw, taking a long draught of cold beer. “That’s the stuff.”

Bopha heads to his cabin, hearing the heavy thuds of Arooj’s fists on Chantico’s door. Bopha sighs, truly not wanting to wade into another argument between the two. He really needs to install a secret passage to his quarters to side step his crazy crew.

“Chantico! I know you’re in there, open the door, we need to talk.” Arooj towers over the door, the bristling muscles of her thickset frame taught with anger. She’s lost much of the silver gray fur typical of the Khadiri from Sama Kathifa since joining the crew, only thin patches remain on her forearms and down her spine, but her imposing height, strength and large yellow eyes make her unmistakably one of Khadira's bio-engineered brood. Bopha, who can count the Khadiri he’s met on one hand, is actually getting used to the strange way she looks. Most people never meet a Khadiri, fewer still have seen one without the heavy cloaks and masks they wear to hide their modifications. Arooj, is anything but inconspicuous, wearing a garish collection of the most trendy fashion items, a long red leather duster, cut at the spine to show off her fur, mirror earrings dangling from her ears like wind chimes and a completely ridiculous pair of pointed shoes, making her already gigantic feet even bigger.

She sniffs the air and looks over to Bopha, her yellow eyes with big black pupils pin him, “Bopha, tell your niece to open the door.”

The intercom in the hallway crackles in with Chantico’s voice, “Don’t you dare Bopha.” 

The skin around Arooj’s eye is swollen and purple. She’s been in another fight. That certainly explains the mood.  

“What is it this time?” Bopha takes another draught of beer, wishing he had picked up another, maybe even a case of it.

“Your brat of a niece, locked me out of shower controls.” 

“You can have access back when you clean your clumps of fur out of the drain!”

Arooj pounds the door with a fist, heaving in big gulps of air.

“Hey!” Bopha walks over, staring up at her and using his ‘captain’ voice, “Cool it, alright. What happened to your eye?”

Her jaw tightens and she backs from the door.

“What do you think?”

“I think some asshole’s missing a pile of teeth.”

She smiles at that, and calms down a bit, “Not just one.”

“As much as it gives me pleasure for you to take down some bigots, maybe avoid doing it here alright? We’ve got enough problems with Khuyen, to not accidentally maim one of her grunts and cause a scene, yeah?”

“I asked them politely first.”

Bopha’s heard Arooj being polite, and frankly it’s not that polite. She’s got a chip on her shoulder the size of a moon.

“Regardless, next time, call me first before you start bashing heads.”

She looks at him for a few seconds, and nods, “Alright, captain.”

“Good, now, go to the head, I’ll deal with Chantico.”

“Like hell you will, old man.” Buzzes Chantico through the intercom.

Arooj cocks her head and gives him the side eye, he waves her away. He hears her heavy footfalls down the hallway.

“Chantico, let me in.”

“Nope.”

“Chantico, I’m giving you an order.”

“Oh no, he’s giving me an order, what am I going to do!” The door remains closed.

When he imagined becoming a starship captain, he certainly didn’t think there would be this much babysitting. Bopha orders his Q to open the door. It opens and he walks into Chantico’s ‘nest’.

“Hey, that’s so rude, how did you override me?”

The cabin is typical, except most of the furniture is missing, replaced by a large interface pod. His niece is laying in it, her eyes are closed, her short cropped hair growing in patches around the scars and inputs from the cloudjack. Thick bundles of data cables run from the pod into the ship's computers.

“I called in a favour from a friend. No more locking me out of my own ship Chantico.”

“You let another cloudhead into my systems?” Her face is utterly slack, her emotions expressing purely in the virtual realm.

“My systems you mean. Now, can you unplug for two minutes so we can chat face to face.”

“I can see you just fine.”

Bopha looks up to one of the cameras in the corner of the room. “Don’t make me do it.”

“Don’t Bopha, it’s not funny.”

“It’s a little funny.” Bopha takes a pen from a nearby desk and walks over to Chantico. He opens the lid of the pod and leans in to write something on her face, just as Chantico’s eyes open, expression returning to her face.

“You’re such a child, Bopha.” Her voice is muddled, the vocal cords not getting enough practice. She stretches her face, blinking rapidly.

“You sound like shit. Haven’t you been keeping up with your stimulation treatment?” He stands back, hands on hips.

“I ran away from home to get away from mom, not switch her for another one.”

“I’m just… making sure you’re fit for duty.”

She frowns at that, “Whatever, Po.”

“Look, just because you’re plugged into ship systems, doesn’t mean you can abuse that power. Arooj is a member of the crew, and you got to stop riling her up with this shit.”

“You can’t complain at all, you have your own shower! I have to share it with the werewolf! You should see–”

“Don’t be that way.”

“What way?”

“Throwing around slurs like a punky teenager.”

“You used to call them that yourself!”

“I did, but I learned and now I don’t and neither will you so long as you’re on my ship, understand.”

Chantico crosses her arms into the picture perfect example of the pouty teen, trouble is she’s in her twenties now and Bopha’s starting to wonder if she’ll ever act it.

“Understand?”

“Yes.”

“Okay, now restore shower privileges to Arooj and I’ll make sure she gets the next clean duty of the head.”

“Whatever you say, Captain.” She salutes mockingly, just as her face goes slack again. The intercom in the room crackles, “Now please get out of my room.”

Bopha shakes his head and takes a sip of beer, the pouch empty. He leans down and kisses her forehead, knowing how much she hates it and grins up to the camera before heading out, “Ciao Sobrina!”

“Bopha! Gross.”

He shuts the door behind him, hearing the lock click. Chantico will be spending the next few days rooting out the overrides he had installed. Here’s hoping she’s not as good as the guy he got.

He finally makes it to his cabin, opening the door and spotting his ancient leather chair, “Hello my old friend.” He collapses into it, fitting perfectly. He closes his eyes and looks forward to not thinking for a solid five minutes, but curse his brain, the image of Val freezing like a shut off drone just barges right in. He has no idea how he’s going to find the credits for the care she needs. With the low pay and Khuyen’s extra cut, there won’t be much to go around. He considers reaching out to Desiree to see if there's anything she could do. By all accounts, the last job he did for her went perfectly, except for getting kicked off the roster. Problems for tomorrow when his brain isn’t so fogged up with brew. He opens up a link to the local network node to distract himself, requesting info on the Intergalactic Rescue Agency. The first search hit is a newsreel from those two morning show baffoons, Mint and Olaf. He downloads the packet and spools it up, the video painting itself across his vision.

“Welcome to Silver Sunrise, the best morning news show as voted by you, employees of the ODI corporation. I’m your host Mint Fonseca, and as always, I’m joined by my co-host Olaf Banza. We have an incredible show for you today, starting with a truly bizarre press conference that happened yesterday afternoon. Take it away Olaf.”

“Thank you Mint. Social was buzzing yesterday with a rare sighting of none other than the controversial Niska Nanotech heiress, Severina Niska. The heiress, who hadn't been spotted since last year’s scandal, attended a press conference for a new company launch.”

Video cuts to Severina at a podium, tall and beautiful, though she takes pains to hide it with an asymmetric haircut of bright white hair, and heavy, jagged makeup popular with the illegal Antiwork movement. The funny thing is, even with all that effort, the millions of credits that went into tailoring her genome still win out. “I’m here today to announce my patronage of the Interstellar Rescue Agency. Selassie’s vision for an organization that offers aid to those who need it, when they need it, without taking a single credit in payment. We live in a political system that benefits only a few, while the many struggle to survive. If you’re a colony in the Frontier struggling to repair a water filtration system and the corporation that sold it to you is refusing to service it, because their parent company wants the land instead. IRA offers a glimpse of what our worlds could be like if we chose generosity over profit. If you need help, we will be there for you, connect to this Q node–”

The video cuts back to the hosts, Mint laughing with her dazzlingly perfect teeth as if she’s in a perfume ad. “Outrageous. You think she’s hit the bottom, but then she keeps going.”

Olaf chuckles as well, “Yes, and so are Niska shares on the Exchange. Down a whole 15% since the press conference. Shareholders are questioning the mental viability of Severina as the appointed heir of the company, so we’ve got Doctor Baladeva, a pre-eminent and longtime guest of the show here to help us unpacked all of this. Doctor, in your opinion is Severina mental fit?”

Video cuts to an older man, shriveled up like a prune with triangular spectacles. Eyeglasses haven’t been needed for over 60 years, but still most people won’t trust a young doctor. Humans are pretty stupid that way.

“Severina exhibits all the symptoms of what we call Histrionic Personality Disorder, or more commonly known as Attention Seeking disorder. One of the symptoms is being easily influenced by others. This Selassie character seems to me, to be taking advantage of her illness, to promote his obviously fraudulent org–”

The video pauses as his Q pings with a call request. Ugh, he considers ignoring it, but then he sees the address. He sits up, brush himself down and accepts the call.

“Hiya,” He tries his best to sound casual, but his heart is thudding in his chest.

“Hi Bopha, it’s nice to see you.” Désirée’s perfect face, framed with long tight copper curls and those dark deep eyes, nearly melts him where he sits. A hint of a smile, both teasing and predatory, makes the longing in his heart that much more unbearable. It's been months since she's called him and as much as he's tried to ignore it, he's missed her.

“You too, it’s been too long.” Her smile stiffens. Desiree hates expectation and he curses himself for saying it. “I mean, it always feels so long when I don’t see you.” He blurts out, feeling smaller in his chair.

Her expression softens and the muscles in his neck relax, not realizing that he was holding them taught. Their conversations are so often like this, a tightrope balancing act, like inching towards a tiger and hoping she doesn't take a bite.

“I know pup. We’ll have to meet soon then, so you don’t forget.”

His heart nearly leaps out of his chest, his mind desperately trying to keep cool, “I’d like that.”

“Of course you would.” She smiles, tauntingly, but her expression quickly turns serious. Bopha knows the look, it’s for when she talks business. “Bopha, I heard you landed a Khuyen contract.”

Bopha can’t help but frown at that. How did she find out? He just met with Khuyen an hour ago. She notices, “I have eyes and ears everywhere, you know that.”

“Yeah, it’s a shit contract, but it might get us back on the roster.”

“I’ve got a proposal for you.”

“What kind of proposal?” Bopha’s mercenary mind kicks in. Desiree's proposal usually come with a big payday if you can stomach the work.

“I’ve got a package waiting for you on Fanrong. I need you to take it into the IRA office and plug it into the CEO’s network node.”

Bopha can't help but remember watching the frigate explode from Garuda's bridge. Blowing up an empty ship is one thing, but an office building?

"Don’t worry pup, it's not that kind of job." Desiree reads his mind, "It's just a simple data transfer, no harm done."

Desiree’s business dealings rarely end without somekind of harm, "I don't know Desiree. We need this contract, if things go south, Khuyen's going to blame me and then we're really shit out of luck."

“You worry too much about that old hag." She waves it off, like an annoying bug, "I’ll make it worth the risk.”

Bopha perks up, knowing full well that he needs the cash and it’s not exactly like he’s got many other options. “How much?”

“100,000 credits.”

That’s a whole lot of credits for an 'easy' job. Bopha’s warning bells are ringing. Who the hell is Desiree working for to throw that kind of cash around? “Why me? For that much, you could get a pro to do it.”

“Are you saying you're not a pro?" She teases.

He smiles, feeling his cheeks flush, "Well maybe not a spywork, but other things."

She laughs, a rare genuine laugh, a high pitched cascade. "You certainly have the ego of one." The smile fades and they're back to business talk, "The client wants it untraceable. Pros leave a trail, even the best ones. But a Stray Captain, already invited into the CEO office is about as untraceable as it gets. So long as you don't get caught that is.”

Bopha doesn't need to ask what happens if he gets caught. Whatever they have between them, she wouldn't lose a wink of sleep letting him take the fall. She's a mercernary as they come. Val thinks that makes her trouble, but she's known trouble. She can never break his trust, because he would never trust her.

Likely, that's why he's the perfect fit for the job. Easy to blame him if things go wrong and if her client has deep pockets, nobody would suspect they'd hire a lowly worm like him. He'd be just one more desperate idiot looking to make a buck.

Bopha has survived this long knowing when a deal is too good to be true, and this one reeks of it. “Let me think it over.”

“What's there to think about? Either you want the job or not. If I can’t count on you, I can find someone else I can.” She spits the words out, and Bopha feels their sting. But as much as he wants to please her, the calculating part of his brain is doing the math.

As shady as her dealings are, Desiree's not a swindler. If she says the money's good, the money's good. And sometimes to get ahead you got to gamble. Bopha's never been one to mull things over for too long, better to jump and see where you land. “Alright, I’ll do it.”

“Good,” a slight smile returns, proud to have gotten her way, “The package will be waiting for you when you dock. Destroy it after the job is done and message me.”

“Sure.”

“I look forward to celebrating.” She winks at him and cuts the call, Bopha’s entire body goes slack in his chair, feeling the sweat trickling on his brow.

100 000 credits. Not enough to get Val the treatment she needs, but not far off it. That's if it doesn't blow up in his face before he can cash the cheque.
 
## Chapter 3

Bopha steps out of the lift onto the bridge of the Garuda, the flickering lights of consoles and panels washed out by Prosper’s soft orange light. His eyes are drawn up to the glassteel dome that covers the nose of the ship, the brown and gold gas giant Revati swallowing up much of the view. Three moons are in sight, but their destination is impossible to mistake. Ships of all sizes and shapes seem drawn to it like a magnet, a steady stream of lights making the journey to and from Fanrong, the capital of the Exchange.

“How long has it been Val?”

Valentina is plugged into her pilot’s seat, reclining fully to face the dome, while her hands grip and adjust flight sticks and tap away at a ring of consoles.

“Three years.” He can tell she’s a little on edge. They both grew up on Fanrong and did everything they could to escape it. Coming back is never easy, there’s always a part of the brain that fears being trapped by it again.
“Never looks as bad from up here.”

“Yeah.”

They look out in silence for a little while, as the moon slowly grows into view. Ships funnel down into lanes, heading for the half dozen grav elevators orbiting the megacity. Humans have been living in the Prosper system for over a hundred years, but even with the millions arriving every few years from Earth, our biggest city is still just a splotch on a moon orbiting a gas giant. It’s dusk now on the moon, and the lights of the city are starting to pop on, a square grid of light coming to life surrounded by an endless patchwork of perfectly square drone farms.

Valentina fires the ion thrusters, slowing down their approach. The thousands of ships that were just lights before, come into view now, light sparkling off old transport frigates, glossy yachts and spherical fast couriers. A long line dropping into the center of a huge metal doughnut.

“Did you check?”

“Of course I checked, the warrant is still up.” 
“Sorry Val.” He had hoped maybe ODI would have given up by now trying to reclaim her, but obviously corporate memories are long.

“Don’t be. I never want to set foot down there again anyways.” She had a life once, a family likely, before the procedure. But she’s never shown an interest in learning about it. When ODI harvests your brain and installs into the Echo frame, they wipe your mind clean of most of your memories, just holding onto the useful skills they can exploit in your ‘second’ life. So to her, all she remembers of her homeworld is slavery. He doesn’t blame her for not wanting to dig around, Bopha has family here and he’s doing his very best to avoid them.

“Still feels good to bring our baby back and shove it in their face doesn’t it?” He grins, stroking the panel next to him.

“That is a silver lining,” She laughs, “I wish I could fly him right up to that rich prick’s mansion.”

“Or we could do one better and steal his new one as well? Expand our fleet.”

“You can barely hold together one ship, how the hell would you manage two?”

“Hey! I’ve kept us afloat for nearly a decade now. I’m doing something right.”

“Yeah, you let me make some decisions sometimes.”

“Whatever–”

The comms buzz, “Unaffiliated Starship Garuda, you are approaching the no fly zone, relinquish control to the elevator AI.” 
Val flicks some switches and types a few commands into the console. The ship starts automatically firing thrusters, adjusting its approach, guiding it through the hole and nudging it into one of the hundreds of grav tether spots. Once locked on, the tether gently lowers them towards the surface.

“Well, I better get ready then.”

“Have fun.”

Bopha walks towards the lift, but stops himself, “Val.”

“Yeah?”

He desperately wants to untangle the knot of guilt in his stomach for not telling her about his deal with Desiree. Last time, he promised to himself he wouldn’t keep that kind of secret from her again. Ever since they stole the Garuda and set off to the Frontier nearly a decade ago, they’ve faced every hardship along the way together. Everytime stupid mistake, every failed scheme, but now it feels different. She’s different. She’s wasting away, and he can’t bring himself to tell her that she is. To tell her what he had to do the last time she started to slip. What he’s doing again. He’s sure the crew suspects something is up with her, but they’re more than happy to accept whatever excuse Bopha gives them. So he’s alone carrying this burden and every time he tries to share it with the one person he trusts more than anyone, he freezes.

“Bopha?” Val is sitting up, her pilot chair, no longer reclining. Her head’s cocked to the side and he knows that she’s seeing right through him. But he can’t let her. It’s not like she would agree with him, only tell him how much of an idiot he is making a deal with Desiree. How she’s not worth the effort.

“Want anything?” Is the best his brain can come up. Typical Bopha, deflect with a laugh.

“You serious? I can’t taste or smell, what the hell would I want from here?”

“A stylish fridge magnet?”

“Fuck off.”

Bopha puts on a laugh and steps onto the lift, hoping she won’t glitch while he’s gone.

…

The lift drops down into the cargo bay, Rezki, frowning, pointing and directing while Arooj and Manu ignore him, moving the stack of empty crates to be filled up with new supplies as they wish, in a convenient but messy pile near the cargo lock. Judging by the sorry state of their finances, they’ll be lucky to fill half of those. Maybe Rezki can bargain for a higher upfront fee.

But supplies are the least of his concerns right now, as he's been mulling over his plan to get Desiree’s package installed without getting noticed and likely thrown into a corporate goulag. His ‘master’ plan that he devised while imbibing a few too many beers last night is starting to seem more like a bad idea than some stroke of genius. But a bad idea is better than no idea at all, so he calls over to Manu, “Manu, I want you to join Rezki and I to meet the client.”

“I’d love to boss!” A huge smile fills the man’s grizzled face. Bopha could have asked him to empty the ship’s sewage tank and he’s pretty sure he would have been just as keen to help out.
“Captain, do we really need Manu and those… things?” Rezki grimaces as he motions to the skittering ferrets hoping from crate to crate.
“Yes Rezki, Manu will be there to handle any technical questions they may have.” And those ferrets, as dumb as it now sounds, are the key to his plan. Bopha pats his pocket, making sure he didn’t forget the key ingredient. The crinkle of the packaging causes one of the ferrets to raise its head, ears pointed towards him, little nose snuffling the air. Not just yet, you little bugger.
“Fine. But you will get your weasels to behave.”

“They’re ferrets, not weasels, Rezki. And they have names.”

“Sounds like you're going to have a blast, Captain.” Arooj snickers, lifting a crate that would usually take two, without the slightest effort.

“Don’t make me bring you too.”

“I’ve got plans.” She shoots back.

“Not involving your fists I hope.”

“I’ll play nice, I promise.”

“We’re not staying on the planet for long, so the supply run comes first, fashion district second, alright? We can only afford a day’s dock fee.”

“Don’t worry, I’ll be back in time.”

“Good.”

The ship whirrs as the landing legs unfold beneath their feet. A few seconds later, gravity shifts slightly, as the ship’s artificial grav field ebbs away. It feels different, stickier and more consistent than the ship’s grav, which is stronger at the feet, but looser at the head. It’s been a few months since they’ve made planetfall and it’s always a strange transition. Manu makes his way over to the lock panel, feeding it voice commands. The cargo locks, hisses as the pressure matches outside, a big thunk and the door lowers, letting the smog curl in. The metallic tang of it smells like home, with all the mixed feelings that comes with it.

The dock outside is a chaotic jumble of stevedores, herding cargo drones, and yelling at each other when they invariably get in the way. A few passenger ships offload their charges, mostly poor workers coming home from their shifts on one of the other moons. Rezki makes his way down to the terminal node assigned to their dock, taking care of their fees and the insane amount of paperwork required to make landfall. Bopha walks down the plank onto the dock floor, feeling a little uneasy. Coming home has that effect. He always half expects a squad of corporate security neatly lined up with an arrest warrant. Somedays it feels like he used up all his life’s luck when he and Val stole the Garuda. The old prick was too indebted to pay for good insurance so they rubber stamped the entire investigation and closed the case after a month. He’d been working at the mansion under a fake id and they couldn’t even be bothered to ask around, or offer a bribe, which in his neighbourhood would have definitely turned him up. Still, he keeps a low profile when he comes home, best not to tempt fate.

A bright yellow courier drone with a black winged shoe emblazoned on the front zooms across the docks, nearly trampling a stevedore, who curses and flicks it the finger. It comes right up to him, “Bopha Krol. Package delivery. Please confirm identity.”

Bopha sends an authentication code with his Q.

“Identity confirmed.” The drone’s stomach opens wide, and it reaches in to hand Bopha a fist sized package.

“Thank you for choosing Hermeasy.” The drone closes its stomach, turns and accelerates away.

Bopha opens the package, a data chip wedged in some foam. He plucks it out and puts it into his pocket.

“Did you pay for that delivery with ship funds?” Rezki rushes over, fingers flicking through his tablet, likely trying to find the receipt for it.

“Relax Rezki, it was complimentary.”

Rezki narrows his eyes suspiciously, putting down the tablet. “Okay.”

“Come on you two, let’s get this over with.”

## Chapter 4

The vactrain slows to a stop at Gaspard station, regular commuters collectively gripping purses and bags tighter and they stand and ready to disembark. Many shoot the three of them suspicious glances. Well maybe not Rezki, in his tailored suit, he looks just like one of them, corporate whatevers going about their business. Though, if you’re working in this part of town, you’re certainly not doing well by any standard. This neighbourhood used to be worker housing when Bopha was growing up, but as the city expanded, proximity to the core made it the go to place for cheap office space for startups of all kinds. 
The door opens and the commuters are out in a flash, like competitive speed walkers they rush for the exit up to the street, eyes darting side to side. Bopha smiles at that. The city may be bigger than when he was last here, but the people are the same. The three of them step out of the filtered air of the pod and immediately regret it. The station reeks of urine and rotting trash. A cleaner drone, covered in brightly coloured profane graffiti, fights a losing battle scrubbing the grimy tiled flooring.

“Oh my god.” Rezki pulls a embroidered handkerchief out of his breast pocket and covers his mouth with it. Bopha spots two toughs peel off from a nearby wall, drawn to the gesture like wolves to blood.

Bopha sighs at the inconvenience, “Manu, take Rezki up to the street, I’ll be right behind you.”

“You got it boss.” Manu grips Rezki’s arm and drags him off towards the exit.

“Manu! Stop it! You’ll wrinkle my suit.”

Bopha walks towards the toughs, blocking their path. Up close, they’re just two teens, rake thin and wearing sleeveless vests, arms drawn over with fake thread lines. Bopha remembers trying that out when he was teen, and just how well that turned out for him. It’ll be nice to pass on the lesson to another generation.

“Get out of the way old man.” One goes to push him aside. Bopha doesn’t hesitate, grabbing his vest and punching the talker right in the nose, dropping him to the ground, blood squirting out. There’s no better weapon than surprise. His hand hurts like hell, but he keeps his face from showing it. He points to the other, “You, stay.”

Eyes wide, the other one stops dead in his tracks, staring back and forth in shock from Bopha to his friend on the ground.

“Wearing fake threads is a good way to get yourself killed.” The words come out, just like they were delivered to him many years ago. It makes Bopha feel old. “Scrub that shit off …

Bopha leaves the two of them there and walks slowly to the exit, his mind a rush of memories. He chuckles, remembering all the stupid schemes he and his friends came up with, thinking they were so smart. All these years later, teenagers doing the same stupid shit is comforting in a way. The world doesn’t change.

As Bopha steps out into the sunlight, ads assault his every senses, peddling various junk with fake smiling models. Bopha’s filter software hasn’t been updated in a few months so most of the ads are blocking as they should, making it near impossible to walk. He turns off his interface fully, the street turning from bright colours to drab greys, pedestrians rushing up and down the street.

He spots Manu and Rezki, Manu’s chest puffed up like a pretty convincing bodyguard.

“Any trouble boss?”

“Nothing I couldn’t handle. Had to turn off my interface, where are we headed?”

“One block up the street, that way.”

Short of the large numbers above the building entrances, the street is a perfect example of copy paste design. Grey concrete printed buildings, all with the same frontage. They find their destination and walk into the lobby. Sad looking corporate hack in second hand suits fill the dingy lobby, exchanging business cards like it’s gonorrhoea. They push past them, most frowning at the sight of them.

The elevator is just big enough to fit the three of them, half of its buttons ripped off. Rezki touches the button for the correct floor with his handkerchief, keeping himself as far from the walls as he can.

“Not exactly luxury office space.” Rezki .

“So long as the money gets into our pockets, they could be working out of a garbage can for all I care.” Bopha reaches into his pocket and feels the chip between his fingers and thumb, wondering what program he’s about to install on their computers. Considering what he read about the outfit, there’s nothing worth stealing, money, data, or otherwise. Best not to think about it. He needs the money and that’s it.

The elevator opens to an aggressively beige corridor. They walk down past a half dozen doors, each with a business name in cheap fake gold lettering. The last door on the left has the Intergalactic Rescue Agency written on it. Bopha presses the doorbell and waits.

“What do you want?” The screen above the door bell flickers on, a young woman half turned to the camera flicking through images on a transparent tablet.

“We’re here to meet Selassie.”

She looks up for nano-second, scowls, and then returns to whatever it is she’s doing, “You don’t look like the type he would meet.”

Bopha clenches his jaw and is about to unleash a string of choice words, when Rezki smoothly pushes him to the side, “We spoke earlier today, I’m Rezki, Clerk of the Garuda.”

She looks up again, squinting. “Oh yeah, I remember you. Alright come in.”

The door slides open and they walk in. The walls of the reception are painted in a haphazard pattern of vibrant purples, oranges and greens so garish Bopha feels like he stepped into a psychedelic music holo. A giant silver emblem of two hands holding a star hangs behind a small desk. As they get closer, Bopha can make out that the young receptionist is flicking through dating profiles.

“He looks nice.” Bopha comments sarcastically.

She looks up with the most apathetic face she can muster. “Selassie’s office is back there, first door.”

“Thank you.” Rezki, hurries Bopha on towards Selassie’s office.

The door is open and inside they can hear a very animated conversation. 
“What’s the catch?” The voice comes from a tinny speaker mounted on a plastic desk. Selassie spots them at the door and unleashes a board smile, waving them in and pointing to the foldout chairs in front of his desk.

“There is no catch my friend. We want to help you for nothing in return.” Selassie pushes up the ill-fitting forest green felt cap that completes his utterly ridiculous uniform. With gold embroidery and shoulder tassels, he looks more like a vintage couch than a business CEO. Bopha suppresses the desire to laugh when he spies Rezki’s horrified grimace. Rezki likes things orderly and this entire room, Selassie included, is a total mess. Overgrown plants fill the corners of the office, making what is already a tiny space even more claustrophobic. The desk is buried under a collection of star maps, photo frames of Selassie with a brood of children, and half-eaten takeout containers. They sit down on the creaky foldout chairs, Manu swatting at the bronze coloured frond tickling the top of his bald head. Bopha can’t spot a slot for the chip under all the mess. This is going to be harder than expected.

“I ain’t into owing favours.”

“You misunderstand. We help you and that’s it, no favours, no payment, we help because it is the right thing to do.”

Selassie smiles again at them, uncovering a plate of cookies on his desk and offering it to them. Manu’s ferrets quickly descend on the plate, nimble fingers grabbing one each and scurrying back to Manu’s lap to nibble on them. Upon seeing the ferrets, Selassie’s face lights up like an excited child.

“I don’t know. It all sounds too good to be true.”

“On old Earth, this kind of work was part of everyday life. People helping people. It is our hope that one day, the spirit of charity will once again flourish in our new homes amongst the stars.”

“What the hell is charity?”

“It’s an old Earth word. It is a gift of service or goods for those who need it most.”

“Right…” The man on the call seems completely unconvinced, and Bopha can’t blame him. Everything about this operation feels like a scam. Bopha has lived in the Exchange his whole life, and he’s never heard of anyone giving anything away for free. Not truly anyways. There’s all kinds of services that don’t cost a credit, but sure as hell they’re getting something out of you instead. Out here, people live and die by the credits in their pockets, and no one would be stupid enough to give them away unless it’s an investment.

“So my friend, shall we help you?”

“You’re not one of those starcults are you? My cousin fell for one of them and he’s never been right since.”

Selassie chuckles, “I promise you, we are no cult. Just people looking to help out a neighbour in need.”

A needle of pain stabs Bopha’s brain as he tries to wrap his head around this completely ridiculous scheme. What’s the angle? Bopha has met his fair share of con men in his time, but Selassie doesn’t fit the bill, it’s all too unbelievable. A good con needs to be grounded in reality, this is just madness.

A soft voice comes on in the background of the call, “He’s pulling our leg Jacob.”

The call goes muffled, but you can still make out the voices, “I don’t know, we need the help, why not give it a try?”

“And then what? Owe this weirdo for the rest of our lives. It’s not worth it. Cut the call.”

“Mei–”

“Cut it Jacob!”

The muffling stops, “Sorry mister, I got to do a thing.”

“Well if you change your mind…” The line cuts out. Selassie’s expression doesn’t miss a beat, there’s a permanent optimism grafted to his face. It is already starting to annoy Bopha.

He turns to them, “Welcome! I am so excited to meet you all.” Selassie gets up from his desk and squeezes past. Bopha stands and offers his hand, but Selassie ignores it and pulls him into a big hug. Bopha coughs and manages to unlatch him, awkwardly tapping Selassie on the shoulder instead.

“You must be Captain Bopha Krol.”

“Yep, that’s me.”

“And Rezki, it is so nice to finally meet you face to face.” He approaches Rezki with his arms wide, hug incoming, but Rezki, uncomfortable with most physical touch, is ready with a deep bow. Selassie stumbles a little, pulling himself into a bow as well, smile never faltering.

“It is my pleasure Selassie, I look forward to going over the details of the contract, I have made an itemised list of comments.”

Selassie pulls himself up from his overly deep bow, one hand clutching his lower back, wincing, “You have a thorough clerk Captain, I wish I were so lucky to have someone as diligent as he in my office.”

Rezki is positively beaming from the compliment, mouth open, ready to start listing his comments, but Selassie turns around towards Manu.

“And this must be Manu, your Mechanical Technician.”

Manu steps forward and pulls Selassie into a hug, “Pleasure to make your acquaintance Mr. Nalangu.”

Selassie laughs, “Selassie, please. We are all friends here.” Selassie pulls back from the hug, looking straight into his scarred, milky white eyes. “You must tell me about your little friends Manu. Do they help you see?”

The ferrets line up on Manu’s shoulders, a pantomime of a line of saluting soldiers. “That they do, these little rascals are my eyes and ears. The big one’s Kufuku, the little one’s Kandaina and the striped one is Hokori.”

“Did you raise them yourself?”

“Yes, I’m a member of the Uplift Society, have you–”

“We can talk about that later Manu, but first let’s get to business.”

“Yes, I have many comments to go through before signing the contract.” Rezki pipes up.

“Of course, please sit.”

Bopha takes off his jacket, resting it on the back of the chair. And settles in as comfortably as he can in the creaky foldout chair. This will be a while.

“Rezki, fire away, I’m ready.”

Bopha suppresses a laugh. No Selassie, you are definitely not ready. Bopha opens up a game of solitaire in his interface. 
After what seems like an eternity, Rezki checks off the final comment on the contract. 
“Is that the last one Rezki?” 
Bopha ears perk up. He pauses his card game, dismissing it from his interface. 
“Yes, everything is in order now,” Rezki skims his tablet, nodding to himself.

Selassie must be using some kind of stimulant because it’s been over an hour of quite possibly torture level boredom and he still has that energetic smile plastered on his face. It’s a little unsettling.

“Do you have any questions Captain, Manu?”
“None for me,” That’s why he pays Rezki, so he doesn’t have to pay attention at these kinds of meetings. It’s expensive, but worth every penny. “Manu?”

Bopha turns to Manu who is snoring softly next to him. Manu sleeps with his eyes open, a side effect of his accident. He gently nudges the man. Manu takes a quick breath in, the ferrets rousing from their respective naps as well.

“Any questions Manu?”

“No, ugh, everything sounds good to me.”

“Fantastic, so how about we sign?” Bopha reaches into his pocket for the chip, still needing to find a slot in Selassie’s terminal to install it. Best if he can get everyone out of the room first.

Rezki hands him the tablet, the signature line at the bottom beckoning, He hold his wrist to it, activating the close proximity authentication of his Q. Selassie, clears a stack of parcels revealing his terminal, authenticating with his own Q. Bopha can see a slot.

“This is truly a most historic moment!” Selassie jumps up from his chair, coming around for what he can only imagine is more hugs. 
“Yeah, sure is.” Bopha quickly steps behind his chair, using it as a shield.

“I have dreamt of this moment my whole life. You will all be a force for good in the galaxy my friends.”

“Can’t say we’ve ever been called that before.” Bopha chuckles.

Selassie’s face grows serious as he looks deep into Bopha’s eyes. “Don’t worry, I’m an excellent judge of character and I know deep in my heart that your three are exactly who we need. You just need a little bit of practice.” As quickly as it came, the serious look disappears, back to the jubilant smile. Bopha, who’s never been one to feel guilt, actually second guesses Desiree's mission for a second. He shakes the thought, reminding himself of the money. But in the back of his mind, something still stings a little.

“Now, I must introduce you to your new crew mates. Follow me.”

Bopha’s heart starts to race, knowing this is his shot. He saddles up to Rezki, opening the treat package he’s been carrying and slipping it into Rezki’s coat. They all step out of the office and start down the hallway, the ferrets, catching whiffs of the smell, their little noses snuffling, tails starting to wag. Hokori is the first to spot it, a rectangular biscuit sticking out the side of Rezki’s coat. He leaps off of Manu and lands on Rezki’s back. Rezki yelps and spins. The biscuit flies to the ground and the other two ferrets are off, swarming at Rezki’s feet. He starts to yell, stomping at them. Manu rushes after the ferrets, yelling at them to behave. Bopha takes advantage of the confusion, to slip back into Selassie’s office, skirting around the desk and slotting the chip into the terminal. A small loading screen appears, loading 5%, 10%. The noise in the corridor starts to quieten. 30%, 35%. Bopha hears footsteps coming towards him. 60%, 65%. He wills the program to install faster. 80%, 85%. The footsteps are just outside the door. 95%, 100%. He rips the chip out of the terminal and shoves it in his pockets, leaping over the table and knocking over one of the take out containers. He lands on his feet, thank god, just as a tall gray-haired woman steps into the office. Her broad scarred face exudes a resting ‘don’t fuck with me’ expression. Judging by the thick threading running up her neck and arms and the two scary looking pistols at her hip, she’s all corporate security. She fixes him with her ice-blue amped eyes, the mechanical irises rotating and expanding as she scans him down to the bone.

He prays she doesn’t take notice of the chip in his pocket. Luckily her gaze is fixed at the hidden pistol up his sleeve. She doesn’t reach for her own, but that heavily threaded, she’d fire off an entire a dozen shots before he can even pull the trigger.

“What are you doing here?” Her voice is husky, though it doesn’t sound natural. Probably regened it to sound tougher for the job.

As cool as he can, he plucks his jacket from the chair, and walks towards her. “Forgot my jacket. We haven’t met,” He offers his hand, “I’m Bopha Krol, Captain of the–”

“I know who you are.” She doesn’t shake his hand, nor does she move from blocking the door.

“Well, you have me at a disadvantage then. Do you work for Selassie?”

“No,” Her amped eyes continue to scan him.

“Right, well he’s waiting for me, so if you don’t mind.” He takes a step forward, but she doesn’t budge, so he ends up stopping a foot away from her face.

“I’ll be watching you.” She slowly steps out of the way.

“Well that’s comforting. Let me know if I have something stuck in my teeth.” He feigns the bravado, but deep down, he’s shaking in his boots. He knows how to handle low level corporate security. Usually not the brightest and easily bribed, but whoever this is, she strikes him more as top level. Deadly and absolutely unflinching in dealing it out.

The scene in the corridor is just as you would expect. Selassie is comforting Rezki, who is flush red with either embarrassment or anger, though probably both. Manu is scolding his ferrets, heads held low, whimpering pathetically. And at the other end of the corridor, casually standing with her arms crossed is the heiress Severina Niska. She’s even more beautiful in person, but in a surreal way. As if someone designed her for a hologame. Her features are all slightly exaggerated, the lines too perfect to be human. The asymmetry of her bleach white hair and dark makeup soften the uncanniness of it, but not enough for her to ever fit in a crowd. She stares right at him, and he waves. She doesn’t wave back.

“Sorry about the mess Selassie.”

“Oh please, you’ve seen my office, I would be the last person to complain about a little mess.” Selassie ushers Rezki into a nearby conference room, “Please everyone, follow me, easier to do introductions in here.”

They all squeeze into the small conference room, the stern-faced merc sticking to Bopha’s back like a tick.

“Bopha, Rezki and Manu, these are your new crew mates, Snow and Zambaga.”

Bopha looks around for the two crew mates, and then realises that he means the Niska heiress and the super soldier. He curses his luck.

“You’re joking right? You want us to babysit the Niska princess? Our ship isn’t exactly set up for that kind of standard of living.”

“We don’t need any special treatment.” Snow’s tone is exactly what you would expect from a spoiled corporate princess, indignant and dismissive. He already dislikes her.

“Slumming it with the plebs eh? Fair enough, but I’m not putting my ship in danger, ferrying around a jackpot kidnap target. We’re an emergency repair vessel, not some fancy yacht with a suite of countermeasures.”

Snow clenches her jaw, “Zamabaga has looked over your modest ship specs and with a few modifications, we can make it work.”

“Modifications? Nobody’s touching my ship!”

“It’s all in the contract Captain, or did you not read it?”

“She’s right, captain. It’s in the contract.” Rezki whispers to him.

His turn to clench his jaw and wish he could be anywhere else right now.

“I told you this wasn’t going to work Selassie. Ignoring his abysmal reputation is one thing, but obviously the man’s both rude and incompetent.”

Rezki grips the Captain’s arm, knowing exactly what is coming, hoping maybe to instil some reason before Bopha makes a scene. But Bopha can’t resist, this spoiled brat needs to be taken down a notch.

“And how the hell would you know competence? Where are the calluses on your hands? You corporate brats are all the same, had everything spoon fed to you since birth and expect the rest of us to bow to your every whim. Well guess what? Strays don’t bow.”

Snow rushes towards him, fists raised, ready to fight. A part of him respects her for fighting her own fight instead of getting her goon to vaporise him. He keeps calm, arms loose, ready to strike when she gets closer. 
Selassie jumps in between them, barking out with an steely authority, “Stop this now!” It’s so out of character that they both just stop, and look at him. Not for the first time today, Bopha wonders who the hell Selassie really is, “Please calm down.” He regains his composure, the kindliness returning to his face.

“Snow, do you have something to say to Bopha?”

Bopha frowns, feeling like he’s been transported back in time to when he was child, held by the scruff of his neck for beating up the grocer’s son. Snow breathes deep, and looks Bopha in the eye, “I’m sorry for what I said.”

“And you Bopha?”

He opens his mouth, ready to launch some more insults, when Rezki grips his arms again. “Captain, we need this job, remember. If we don’t get the advance, we’re stuck on planet and we won’t be able to pay the dock fees. We’ll lose the ship.”

Manu claps him on the shoulder, “Don’t worry Captain, I’ll make sure that whatever they install, we’ll have full control of it.”

They haven’t even started the job yet and Bopha can’t wait for it to be over. “I’m sorry for calling you a brat. But if we’re going to take you two on, I want assurances that my crew and my ship will be safe.”

“I promise.” Snow offers her hand.

He sighs, knowing he has no other option that to trust for now. “One last thing,”

“Of course there is,” Snow rolls her eyes.

“My ship, my rules. You may be bankrolling this operation, but if you’re going to berth with us as crew, then you’ll be crew. No special treatment. Can you handle that?”

“I can handle it.”

He shakes her hand.

“Fantastic! Now that was an introduction I won’t soon forget.”

## Chapter 5

“So that’s your ship?” Zambaga scoffs as Bopha points out the dark green Garuda amongst the scattered ships of the dock. Shaped like a pine cone with overlapping dark green retractable solar scales protecting the hull, its bow is a curved alloy shield streaked with scorch marks and gashes. Emblazoned on the side is the mythical Garuda, holding the Naga in his claws. After all these years, it still feels like coming home.

“Never judge a ship by its hull.”

A cargo drone lumbers by, clearing a line of sight to the ship.

“Fuck,” Bopha jumps behind Manu. At the Garuda’s airlock, a woman is pounding at the door, yelling something over the din of the docks. 
“Something we should be worried about?” Zambaga puts a hand on one of her pistols.

“How the hell did she know we were here? Manu, head around, we’ll come in through the other airlock.”

“Captain, what is going on?” Snow, with a simple duffel bag strapped over her shoulder, could not look any less impressed. 
“Family.”

She nods, the answer seemingly enough to explain his behaviour.

Manu tries his best to look bigger than he already is, but it’s all for nothing when Jorani turns around and spots them.

“Bopha!” She yells, her face flush with rage, stomping towards them, “Are you seriously trying to hide from me?”

Bopha sighs deeply, “Rezki, take our new crewmembers and show them around the ship, I’ll handle this I guess.”

Manu claps him on the shoulder, “Good luck boss.”

The crew quickly steps out of the way of his sister’s war path, skirting around her to get to the airlock.

“Hey there Jorani,” He smiles,

“Don’t fucking ‘Hey there’ me!” She comes right up to him and throws a punch towards his face, but he knows his sister, and her anger, so he’s ready, easily side-stepping the blow, but she’s predicted it and lands a blow to his stomach before he can squirm out of the way. The wind blows out of his mouth, and he hunches over.

“You little coward. Did you really think you could come back home and get away without me knowing?”

Bopha pulls himself back up, already tired of the exchange, “To be honest, yes.”

“You’re a real piece of shit brother.”

“Well the deep pain in my stomach seems to prove me right.”

“Don’t. You know exactly that you deserve it. You stole my fucking daughter from me Bopha.” The rage in her eyes gives way a little, a few tears escaping down her cheeks, leaving two dark lines of masquera.

“Sis, she came to me. ”

“She’s just a child, she needs her mother.” His sister’s shoulder slump, the fight ebbing away.

“She’s not and you know it. She’s a working member of my crew and she’s good at it. You’d be proud of her.”

At that she starts to sob, once, twice, before drawing in a deep breath and steeling herself from her emotions. Jorani, his big sister, was always the tough one.

“She won’t talk to me Bopha.”

“She’ll come around.”

Jorani looks around the dock, avoiding eye contact, “Yeah, maybe.”

Bopha notices the fine cut of her suit, the jewellery on her fingers, “Looks like you’re doing well for yourself.”

And just like that, the tiger is back, eyes turning fierce, as she remembers the other grievance that’s estranged them, “No thanks to you.”

“Come on Jorani, do we really need to go down this road again.”

She stares at him, mulling it over. Her expression eventually softens, only a little, “I got a promotion.”

“Congratulations,” He says it, but doesn’t mean it. Climbing the corporate ladder is prison he wouldn’t wish on anyone, especially not his sister.

“Yeah, well it’s helping with the debt payments.”

Bopha doesn’t bite. He’s said everything he needs to say about his Dad’s debt.

“You look like shit by the way.” She doesn’t say it mockingly, more teasing than anything.

“It’s coming back into style I think,” He grins and so does she.

A silence settles between them, not awkward, just vast. Growing up they were inseparable. Jorani would pull him out of every bit of trouble he would find himself in, beating up kids twice her size to protect her brother. But when their Mom left with all of the family’s savings, things changed. How could they not. Jorani had to start working at age 14 to help cover the instance debt they now found themselves in. After then, Bopha had to fend for himself.

“You know, there’s always a spot for you on my ship.”

“You may have it in you to run from all your problems Bopha, but that’s not who I am.” The anger is still bubbling below the surface, but he knows it's not really towards him. They both carry that rage, towards the parent who left them destitute. Closure is not something either of them will likely ever have.

“Still, if you need to leave, I’ll be there.”

She pulls her hand to her mouth and bites at a nail, just like when she was a kid. She catches herself, and shoves her hand down to her side.

“Tell Chantico that I love her, and that I want to talk to her,” She swallows hard, “When she’s ready.”

She grabs Bopha into a hug. It lasts only a few seconds, before she lets go and walks away, not looking back once.

## Chapter 6

Bopha knocks at Chantico’s door.

“You know you can just send me a message like a normal person?”

“As you constantly remind me, I’m not, so here I am. I’ve got something important to talk to you about.”

“If it’s about Mom, I don’t want to hear it.”

“Chanti. Please, just let me in.”

“Ugghh, fine.” 
The door opens and Bopha walks in. The room stinks, or maybe it's her. Probably both.

“Christ, you need a shower. It’s riper than a pig pen in here.”

“Did you seriously come by to boss me around again?” Chantico is sitting on her bed, playing with an old handheld console. As much as she may try to escape this reality, there’s still some things you can’t reproduce in the cloud. Like playing your favourite childhood game when you feel like shit.

“I’ll take any chance I can get, but no.” He sits down next to her on the bed, “I’m guessing you saw your mom pounding away at the airlock.”

She doesn’t reply, only gives a quick nod.

“I know you’re still angry with her.”

“Angry?! She thinks I’m a freak!” She tosses the console away, slumping down onto her bed and covering her head with her pillow.

“You certainly smell like one,” The pillow flies in an arc, smashing him in the face.

“You’re such an ass Po.” She laughs and sits back up. “What did she say?”

“She says she loves you and that she wants to talk to you when you’re ready.”

Chantico mulls it over, biting her lip, “I don’t know if I’m ready.”

He grabs her shoulder and pulls her close, “Trust yourself. You’ll know when it’s right. Your mom is tough and stubborn, like every de la Rosa, but I think she’s coming around.”

“Thank Po, for everything.”

He kisses her on the forehead, “Denada Sobrina.” He pats her on the leg, “Now get your ass cleaned, you stink.”

“Yeah, yeah.”

—

Bopha checks his inbox for the twentieth time, but Desiree has still not answered his message. It’s not out of the ordinary for her to take some time to get back to him, but when there’s that many credits on the line, he’s feeling a little jittery about it. What if she played him and he gets nothing? So far, nobody seems to have noticed whatever the hell it was that he downloaded on there. He fidgets with the chip in his pocket. Desiree told him to destroy it, but for some reason, his gut told him to hold onto it. Might be worth some credits if he can figure out what it does. He’s sure as hell not going to spool it up on his ship.

Manu walks up to him, offering some homemade snacks. “Want one boss? Made them myself.” Half of the plate is already gone, his ferrets quietly munching away without him knowing. And the other half, he can only imagine, are covered in dirty paw prints. “No thanks Manu, had too much for breakfast.”

The entire crew is gathered in the mess hall. Save for the cargo bay, it’s the only place, now that there are two more, where they can all meet without having elbows in each other’s sides. Bopha had to nearly drag Chantico out for their inaugural assignment meeting with the Agency, so she’s skulking as far away from everyone else as possible, light flickering over her eyes with god knows what. You can force the body, but the mind does whatever it wants.

Rezki is sat directly next to Snow, constantly looking over her shoulder at her tablet, to Snow’s continual annoyance. Snow is setting up a portable holo projector on the bolted down dining table. Arooj is lounged out on the sofa, tauntingly staring at Zambaga, who has yet to break eye contact. Good chance that Zambaga, as someone who’s worked up the corporate security ladder, has seen combat on Muzdahir against the Khadiriians there. That might cause some problems down the road, but so long as it's just a staring contest, he’ll park that problem for later.

Snow flicks a switch and the iris of the holo projector opens, a swarm of holos buzzing out of it, forming a perfect luminescent white cube over the table.  
“Captain, is everyone here?”

The lift comes down from the upper deck, Val stepping out and walking over. 
“All here now.”

Snow starts tapping away at a tablet, the holos coalescing into a sphere.
“This should be good,” Val whispers to him as she settles in next to him.

“Who do you think is crazy enough to call these guys for help?”

“My bet’s on some drugged up commune on the Frontier looking snacks.”

“Maybe an old lady’s cat’s up a tree.”

She snickers at that.

“IRA’s mission is to help those in need. Zam and I are excited to finally be able to do that with the help of all of you. Selassie has sent me our first assignment. A colony on Fornax is suffering from an unknown illness. One of the colonists sent us a call for help a few hours ago. Here it is.”

The holos morph into a face, it’s young, boyish with a wisp of a mustache and two big brown eyes.

“Is this the Rescue Agency?”

“Yes, my friend, how can we help you?” Selassie’s unmistakable voice booms from the little projector speakers.

“There’s something happening here, people are getting sick, but it doesn’t make any sense. The mayor says it’s nothing to worry about and that it’ll go away with time, but it’s been a week and the symptoms are only getting worse.” The young man’s voice is panicked, words tumbling out. “I’ve called everyone I could think of, but nobody wants to help. I don’t know what else to do.”

“Don’t worry son, we will help. What is this illness, what are the symptoms?” 
“It started out like a cold, runny nose, coughs, nothing we haven’t dealt with before, but after a day or so, strange things started happening. We started feeling things, when they didn’t make any sense. Angry all of sudden, sad out of nowhere. It’s like our brains are glitching. A group of children went completely berserk this morning and nearly killed their teacher. This isn’t normal. I–”

The face turns, as if something was happening behind him. “I have to go, here are our coordinates. Please help us.” The call cuts.

“Jesus.” Bopha lets out.

“Kind of wishing it was the cat.” Val replies.

“Time is of the essence. The coordinates are for a colony on Fornax.” The holos change shape to show Fornax, a blistering planet in the Fuerza system. “Since we’re dealing with a biological agent, we’re going to need full quarantine gear.”

“Obviously.” Arooj stands up from the couch, “Don’t worry little lady, we know what we’re doing.” Arooj walks away.

“Excuse me, but this meeting isn’t over.”

Arooj stops and looks at Bopha.

He nods, and she continues on her way.

“Captain, we need to discuss our plan.”

“This may come as a surprise to you, but this crew has responded to more than a dozen pathogens. We know what we’re doing.”

Snow opens her mouth to protest, but Bopha doesn’t give her the chance. “Val, lay a course. Get us there as quick as you can.” She nods and heads out, “Manu, I want all of our pathogen gear, ready and loaded in the shuttle. And I think we still have that pop up tent?”

“Yeah, it needs a patch or two, but I should be able to get it fixed before we get there.”

“Great, do it.”

Snow walks over to Bopha, “Captain, can we have a word in private?”

“Sure thing, follow me.”

They take the lift up to the Bridge, Val already nestled in her pilot’s chair, plotting their course. They walk over to the office. It’s a small space, with a desk and terminal and not much else. It’s technically the Captain’s, but Bopha doesn’t use it, so Rezki spends his time there doing Clerk stuff. He closes the door behind them.

“Captain, this is not how the Agency works.”

“It is how we work. You hired us because this is what we do for a living.”

“I find it hard to believe that you’re prepared for a potentially deadly mystery pathogen.”

“And what’s that supposed to mean?”

“I’ve walked around this ship, looked at your gear. Half of it is broken, and the other half is two decades old.”

“Who gave you permission to snoop around my ship?”

“I did. I am funding this operation and–”

“Didn’t take long for you to pull that card eh?”

Her face is beat red, fists balled up.

“I knew this was a mistake.”

As much as he’s enjoying getting under her skin, he needs the job and thinks he may be pushing a little too far, “Look, those colonists need help. We’re going to help them. We may not be some fancy biotech firm with pristine white lab coats, but we get the job done. Working on the Frontier is messy work. Welcome to messy.”

“You trust that Khadiriian?”

Bopha wonders what she means by that. He knows bigotry against them runs deep in the corporate world, but he figured someone funding this kind of lovey dovey bullshit would be more open-minded.

“I wouldn’t touch a plague job with a thousand foot pole if she weren’t working on this ship. She’s brilliant at what she does and she’s never failed yet.”

Snow nods, the endorsement seeming to ease some of her misgivings. 
“As for landfall, I think it’s best if you stay on the ship.”

“Not going to happen.”

“I’m not going to–”

“Zam and I will be going down, one way or the other.”

He looks her over, wondering what exactly she means by the other. At gun point?

“Fine, but Rezki’s going to make you sign some waivers. I’m not having Niska lawyers bury me alive if you die down there.”

“Whatever,” She opens the door and walks out.

“Good meeting!” He calls after her.

## Chapter 7

Bopha and Manu heave another crate of equipment into the drop shuttle.

“I think that’s as much as we can fit in there, boss. Might have to do two trips.”

Last thing Bopha wants to do is waste energy doubling up their drops, “Nah, we’ll make do. Let’s pull out the crate of–”

A flash of red in the corner of his eye, a call incoming from Val. “One sec Manu.”

He opens the channel, “What is it Val?” 
“Bopha, umm, the Gatekeeper wants to talk with you and Snow.”

“Haha, very funny, we’ve got lots of work to do down here if you’ve got time to kill with bad jokes.”

“I’m not joking.”

“The Gatekeeper wants to talk with me? Come on Val, at least make it believable.”

“Bopha, I am not joking.”

“Why the hell would it want to talk to me?”

“How the hell would I know? Snow is on her way, so you better get your ass up here.”

“Right.” He cuts the call.

“Did you just say the Gatekeeper wants to talk with you?” Manu asks, the excitement in his voice palpable.

“I guess. I have to… get to the bridge. Can you finish…” He just waves around, the thought escaping him. He hurries over to the lift and presses the button for the bridge. The Gatekeeper. The mysterious alien artificial intelligence that operates the mirror gates and gifted humanity the star systems they now call home. After more than a century, they still know so little about it. No clue as to its origin, its motives, its technology. All attempts to scan or study it have come back with nothing, so people just stopped trying. It just is. It makes travel between star systems possible. It works without fail so no one ever questions it, well maybe those conspiracy nuts do, but the average person is too busy surviving to care. 
There’s only ever been second hand accounts of meetings with the Gatekeeper. It values its privacy and no attempts to record it or even take photos of it has ever worked. Everyone describes its appearance differently, but it always presents itself in human form. Bopha sure that whatever this conversation will be about, he could probably sell it for a pretty penny, if anyone will believe he’s not conning them that is. Fake accounts of the Gatekeeper are a dime a dozen, usually involving somekind of invasive probing or sexual encounter. He hopes neither is in store for him today.

The lift slows down and comes to a stop at the bridge. Snow is already there, arms crossed, nervously tapping her fingers on her arm. Obviously something new for her as well. Good, Bopha doesn’t want to be at a disadvantage.

“Val, what do we–”

Suddenly, a glowing human form appears. It is androgynous, its features difficult to pin point. One second it is older, with wrinkles, and liver spots, and the next its young, with a wispy peach fuzz moustache and acne. Long hair turns to short, dark skin to light, each transition is so smooth that without focusing on it, its easy for it to seem ‘normal’. The changes slow, the form settling into a bland average. So perfectly average that its averageness becomes supernatural.

“Hi!” The Gatekeeper’s voice is equally average. If you closed your eyes, you could pretty much assign it to anyone you can imagine and it would fit.

Snow and Bopha look at each other, both so out of their depths. Snow speaks first. 
“Gatekeeper, it is an honour to meet you. I–”

Bopha, not wanting to be the background character to this interaction, “Welcome to the Garuda. What brings you to my ship?”

The Gatekeeper smiles, it is cheekier than Bopha was expecting. Honestly, Bopha’s not exactly sure what he was expecting, but this certainly isn’t it.

“Captain Bopha Krol, I thank you for your welcome. And Snow, it is my honour to meet you. As for what brings me to your lovely ship…” The Gatekeeper strolls around, the glowing nature of what Bopha can only assume is a light projection, making noise as it walks, as if it has weight.

“I am curious. That is what brings me here.”

“Curious about what?” Snow’s face is a mask, but he can tell by her stance, that she’s not drunk the coolaid on the Gatekeeper, and there’s a healthy suspicion lurking under the surface. Good, Bopha thinks. He’s not the only one terrified of a super powerful being taking an interest in them.

“I have watched your kind for a long time and consider myself to know it very well. But you two, together on this ship, shepherding Selassie’s fledgling Agency. There’s something new here. Something I haven’t seen in a long time. Something harder to predict.”

That last line cools Bopha’s blood. Is unpredictable bad? In that moment, the power of the Gatekeeper comes into full view. Bopha has passed through the mirror gates more times that he can remember. And everytime, he has never questioned that he would appear on the other side. That trust feels foolhardy all of a sudden.

The Gatekeeper looks at him, as if seeing the thought pop into his head.

“There’s nothing to worry about Bopha. I know this meeting must be unnerving for both of you, but let me assure you that I am just an observer. Curious about two people and what changes they may bring to these worlds.”

“She’s the one looking to change things,” Bopha blurts out, hoping to place Snow squarely in its crosshairs, not himself, “I’m just here for the money.”

The Gatekeeper laughs, “Of course you are.”

Bopha doesn’t know what that means.

“Why now? Selassie has been working on the Agency for the better part of his life.”

“That is a good question. Selassie is an extraordinary person, and I am very fond of him.”
They both shoot a glance at each other at that comment.

“But he is only one piece of a larger puzzle. Without you Snow, his ideas would not flourish and without you Bopha, those ideas would not be tested. So here I am, seeing everything come together. Only time will tell whether this lonely tree bears fruit.”

“And what does that matter to you?” Bopha can’t say that he’s happy being ropped into this kind of prophetic mumbo jumbo.

“As strange as it may sound, I care more about humanity than you know.” There’s a softness to the way it says it, like a mother fretting over a child.

“Why?” Snow asks.

“I’ve told you as much as I can Snow. Any more and–” The Gatekeeper’s form stops, the ease of motion frozen like stone. A second passes. “I must go. It calls me back.”

And just like that, the Gatekeeper disappears.

“Did you get any of that Val?”

Val, who’s been quietly sitting in her pilot’s chair this whole time, looks at him and says, “Any of what?”

Christ, was she glitching that whole time? “Val, check the internal cameras. Did we get any footage of the Gatekeeper.”

“When was it here?”

“Just look.”

“There won’t be anything.” Snow says, “It never leaves a trace.”

“And how would you know that?”

“Let’s just say my parents are interested in its activities.”

“She’s right, there’s a gap in the camera footage. And my memory’s been wiped for that same time slot.”

Bopha turns to Snow, “So if you're the expert, what the hell was that all about?”

“I’m no expert, Captain. No one is. Not even my parents. I’m in the dark as much as you are.”

“Sounded like Selassie’s already met it. Did you know that?”

“No. He never mentioned it.” She walks off to the lift.

“Hey, where are you going?” 
“Getting ready, we still have a mission to do. And none of this changes that.”

The lift lowers, Snow sliding out of sight.

“Christ Val, what the hell have we gotten ourselves into.”

They both look up at the approaching Mirror Gate. It looks so incredibly mundane. A century of science fiction had prepared humanity for fantastical constructions of exotic materials and designs, but instead the one and only piece of alien architecture they’ve encountered is a drab gray metallic cylinder wrapped around a pitch black hole. If it weren’t for its size, you’d think you were just looking at an unfinished cargo freighter. The hole in the center can swallow up more than a hundred ships at once, with a hundred kilometers between each. The one and only truly strange thing about it, other than the mysterious way it transports ships between far flung star systems, is the black fog inside. It’s not fog, obviously, but there’s really no better description, as you enter the gate, the darkness seems to wrap around you, making the light of the stars outside disappear, as well as the blinking lights of any other ships around you. Scientists have attempted to sample whatever it is, but the Gatekeeper is secretive about its technology and has so far prevented it.

As they start to get closer, the circle of the cylinder expands until it is out of sight and all that is before them is that impossibly dense black. They slip into it, as they have thousands of times before, Bopha feeling anxious for the first time in a long while. Over the years, using the gates had become no different than using an elevator, there was always a part of you that knew you could be stuck in a deathtrap if that day it decided to stop working, but the risk was so low you convinced yourself it could never happen. The Gatekeeper’s visit was one hell of way to remember how absolutely at the mercy they are to this alien intelligence.

Val sends the Gatekeeper their desired destination, it sending back a curt confirmation.  
It happens gradually, a fuzzy vibration spreading through Bopha’s body. Everything starts to feel denser, thicker, as if the regular universe is fragile and thin, but here it is strong and unbreakable. Nobody truly knows what happens here, but the leading theory is some form of quantum entanglement. A perfect duplicate of the ship and everything in it being crafted one atom at a time across the galaxy. Once complete, the original version of the ship is destroyed and the atoms recycled to make the next ship coming back. Bopha doesn’t like thinking too long about the philosophical ramifications of that. The feeling of solidity starts to fade, and then suddenly, they’re out on the other side, having travelled countless lightyears in a matter of seconds. Only the size of marble, the orange star of the Fuerza system brightens as the fog lifts.

## Chapter 8 

Bopha wakes up with a start in his chair, covered in chip dust and surrounded by a depressing semi circle of empty beer pouches. Ever since their meeting with the Gatekeeper, he hasn’t been able to sleep without a little liquid help. His head starts its scheduled wind up to full blown migraine, so he stumbles out of his chair to the cabinet next to the sink. He pops a pill, the headache vanishing almost instantly. He takes another to strip the alcohol from his system and then on cue, his stomach grumbles for some breakfast. He throws on his bathrobe, and slips into his sandals, opening the door to his cabin.

Val is in her pilot’s chair, the Fornax’s rusty orange ball about the size of grapefruit above their heads. He’s got just enough time for some breakfast before they enter orbit.

“Morning,” He croaks, surprised by the hoarseness of his throat.

Val looks over, “Still not sleeping eh?”

“Yeah.”

“I’m sure Arooj could whip you up something–”

He waves the suggestion away like an annoying fly, “No, no, no. I’ll be fine.”

“Yeah, you really look it.”

“Anything interesting on the way?”

“Nothing but stars. Haven’t seen a ship yet.”

“Just how you like it.”

“Yeah.”

“Well I’m going to go grab some–”

“Captain,” Snow suddenly appears in front of him. He squints a few times, his brain taking its sweet old time.

“Snow, I’m just heading–”

“You’re not ready?” She looks him up and down, “You realise this is an emergency? People could be dying down there.”

“Most likely, but the ship only goes as fast as it goes, so if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to get some breakfast.”

“Are you really that heartless?” The last few days have been tense to say the least. Snow has found something to complain about for pretty much every detail of the ship, its crew and their operation. It was infuriating at first, but now it’s just starting to be tiresome.

“Caring about others doesn’t pay the bills. I do the work, that’s all.”

“You know, that you’re everything that’s wrong with us as a species.”

Bopha rolls his eyes, and walks past her to the lift. “Easy to say when you’re responsible for making us that way.”

“I am not my parents!” She yells it, and then immediately looks embarrassed. She’s too easy, he thinks to himself, grinning.

“Sure thing princess.” He’s just about to press the button to send the lift down, when Val’s hands start frantically typing away at her console.

“Ugh, Captain, we’ve got a ship incoming. Fast.” 
He sighs, knowing that breakfast won’t be happening this morning. He shuffles over to the pilot’s nest. “What colours?”

“It’s corporate. ONI security.”

“Alright, you know the drill. Go dark and see if we can shake them off.”

“What are you doing?” Snow pipes up.

“What does it look like we’re doing, we’re hiding.”

“It’s a corporate vessel, not pirates.”

“Yeah, pirates usually warn you before they shoot.”

“This is ridiculous. Open a comm line and I’ll handle this.”

“Look Snow. You don’t how it is out here. Corporate security doesn’t get to see much action, so they practice on small ships no one cares about. We are one of those ships, so we hide and get the fuck out of here.”

“That’s unacceptable.” She walks over and opens a comm channel before either of them can stop her.

“ONI vessel, why are you on an intercept course?”

No response. 
“So much for hiding. Can we outrun them Val?”

Val swats Snow’s hand out of the way, flipping through complex sets of vector charts, “Their ship yes, their missiles probably not.”

Snow opens the comm once again, “ONI vessel if you do not change course, you will be in direct violation of the Frontier treaty.”

Bopha snatches her hand away from the console, “You think they give a shit about the treaty? They’ll slag us and not leave a fucking molecule of evidence left.”

Still no response from the ship.

Snow lets a deep breath out, looking resigned to something she didn’t want to do, “Captain, I can handle this. Please, let me try one more time.”

Bopha looks at Val. She shrugs her shoulders.

“Fine. Val starts getting us ready if we need to start dodging missiles.”

Snow taps the comm line again, “This vessel is carrying a percentage owner of the Exchange. Any hostile action against this vessel will be considered a hostile action against the Exchange itself.”

“Stray vessel, what are you playing at?” An arrogant voice buzzes over the intercom.

“This is Severina Niska, and unless you don’t want you and your entire crew condemned to a debtor’s prison, change your course.”

“Bullshit. I must admit it’s a new one for me. Usually you scumbags just plead or run. It’s refreshing to hear a little creativity for once.”

Snow’s cheeks flush bright red, her fists balled up. Bopha is happy to see her anger directed at someone else for a change.

“Check my credentials asshole!” She flicks with her hand, the console sending out an encrypted key, “Or don’t, and just shoot at us. Honestly, at this point, I hope you do, so I can look forward to visiting you in whatever dark hole you’ll be thrown in after all this is done.” Snow heaves in and out, her rage emanating off her like a bonfire.

“Christ,” Bopha rubs his brow, his headache making a miraculous comeback.

“Some fire! I like that, this has been fun, but time to end–” The line cuts, a murmuring in the background, “What? What do you mean?”

Silence falls over the comm, the line still open.

“Umm, apologies, my deepest apologies. I.. ugh.”

“What’s your name?” Snow’s rage is still not sated.

“Umm, it’s Greg Grapes.”

Bopha chuckles at the obviously made up name.

“I’ll be seeing you Greg.” Snow cuts the line.

“The ONI vessel is backing off.”

“Well, I can’t honestly say that’s how I saw things going.”

“Me neither,” Snow admits, her cheeks returning to their normal pale colour.

“Thanks for nearly getting us killed.” 
Snow doesn’t seem to notice the remark, looking lost in thought, “Is it really like this out here?”

Bopha frowns at her, annoyed once again of having to ferry around someone so naive, “Yeah, this is how the rest of us live.”

She looks up at the Fornax, as it slowly expands into view, not saying a word.

“Hey, you hear anything from your contact down there?”

“No, still no response.”

“Well that’s not good. Val, can you hail the colony itself?”

Val taps away at her console, “Can’t get through, the caves are deep, too much interference for a tight beam link. And without another Q address to ping, we’ve got nothing to go by.”

“I hate surprises.”

## Chapter 9

Arooj squeezes into the drop shuttle last, her wide shoulders pushing Bopha against the net covered cargo crates that hem them in on every side. She drops into her seat, and pulls on her safety harness. Zambaga stares at her, all the while polishing a strange looking carbine.

“You got something stuck in your eye?” Arooj runs her hands through her hair, spinning into a bun, her arms flexing in a show of strength.

“Never met a helpful Shezy before.”

“Zam.” Snow places her hand on Zam’s leg. Zam looks at her charge, chomping down on her teeth something fierce. “Zam?”

She takes a deep breath in, and turns to face Arooj, “Sorry.”

“That’s it? Sorry? For what? Killing my people? Killing my world?”, Arooj nostrils flare, her chest heaving. Bopha’s happy she’s strapped into her seat, though with those longs arms, she might actually be able to reach Zam.

“Arooj, cool it. We’re on the job. Figure out your personal shit on your own time.”

She doesn’t break eye contact, but she relaxes a bit in her seat, “Yes, Captain.”

“Good,” Bopha opens a nearby case, pulling out two pistols. He hands one to Arooj, who snaps it onto her waist. He checks the battery, looking it over and making sure everything looks functional. Been a while, since they’ve needed them.

“Captain, why are you bringing a gun?”

Bopha frowns, looking over at Zam polishing her carbine. “Same reason she is. We’re walking into a plague town. Desperate people do desperate things, like trying to steal my shuttle. Not to mention the wildlife on Fornax isn’t exactly cute and cuddly.”

“You can’t bring those. Your contract prohibits you from using lethal weaponry.”

“This contract is going to be the death of me. What the hell is that then?” Bopha points to Zam’s carbine, “A water gun?”

“It’s a synaptic neutraliser.” Zam corrects him, a little offended.

“Zam is a pioneer of non-lethal protection.”

“Like hell I’m going to trust my life to some toy.”

“I’d be glad to give you a demonstration.” Zam points the carbine at his chest, a sly smile on her face.

“Zam.” Snow gives her the side eye.

Zam rolls her eyes, going back to polishing.

“Captain, this is non-negotiable. You want to get paid? The guns stay here.”

“I’m not walking around down there without some piece of mind.”

Zam reaches into a duffel bag next to her, pulling out two pistols, and handing them both to Bopha, “Here. Shoots the same as a gun, so you should be able to handle it.”

“This a synaptic whatshamacallit too?”

“No, I call those Puff Cuffs.”

“Are you serious?”

“They shoot out a quick growing algae that feeds off kinetic energy. More you move the faster it grows.”

“A fucking gardening gun?”

“What algal species?” Arooj asks.

Zam looks at her suspiciously, “Trade secret.”

Arooj snorts, popping the barrel off the gun and examining a cartridge. She brings it up to her nose, snuffling it. “Breaker’s Beard, but mixed with a few ???? genes. Clever.”

“I’m not just a pretty face.”

Arooj chuckles. Manu’s face appears in the shuttle doorway. “She’s all ready, Captain.”

“Alright Manu, close her up.”

“Good luck down there.” The shuttle door closes with a hiss. Snapping tight with magnetic locks. They jostle in their seats as it’s lowered into the airlock. A hiss and rush outside and then silence. The windows, on the outside of the shuttle, mostly obstructed by the crates, show glimpses of stars as they lower towards the surface, the Garuda’s grav tether slowing down their approach. It takes about fifteen minutes before they make landfall, the planet’s notorious heat making the shuttle air conditioning struggle to keep the air fresh.

Bopha releases his straps, sticking his ‘gun’ to his waist and squeezing over to the hatch, releasing the door. Dry air rushes in, sucking the moisture out of his lungs. He swallows and coughs a few times. He steps out onto the crunchy sand, twenty meters or so from the mouth of a cave system. It’s early night, the temperatures still dropping from the 60 degrees highs of the day. His interface clocks it at 38, and he immediately wishes he were wearing sandals instead of boots. He can already feel the sweat starting to pool at the bottom.

A gust of wind kicks up some sand, he throws a hand in front of his face to shield his eyes as sand peppers his face. Arooj steps out next to him, carrying a toolbox of medical equipment and a quarantine suit draped over her shoulder.

“I’m not looking forward to being roasted alive in that quarantine suit.”

“Quit complaining, at least you’re not covered in fur.” Arooj puts her toolbox down, sliding her arms through the suit sleeves and lifting the hood over her head. She clicks a button on the sleeve, and the fabric unfurls, covering her legs and torso snugly.

“You look like a stuffed sausage in there. How are the seals?” Bopha does a little walk around her, checking to make sure the multitude of patches are holding. Arooj taps away at the integrated panel, checking systems.
“Everything’s nominal. You should get yours on.”
“Yeah,” Bopha steps back into the shuttle, Snow and Zam already outfitted in their suits, looking as skeptical as always.

Bopha puts his on, annoyed at the chaffing around his thighs. He sticks his gun to his waist and they all head out into the sun. Bopha locks up the shuttle, “Alright, let’s do this.”

Snow leads the way, Zambaga close behind, fingers never drifting from her carbine. I’m sure the Agency’s non-violence policy is more of a suggestion for her than a hard rule.

Bopha quickens the pace, hoping to reach the cave mouth’s shade before melting into a puddle. When they get there, three people are waiting for them. Bopha didn’t spot them before, the glare off the sand making the cave mouth a dark abyss. A middle aged man, with pudgy cheeks and little ferret eyes is flanked by two burly men, makeshift weapons held casually in their arms.

“I think you must have made a wrong turn friends, these caves are claimed.” Pudgy cheeks wipes his brow with a handkerchief, his eyes darting around like a trapped animal.

“My name is Snow, I’m here on behalf of the Intergalactic Rescue Agency to lend your colony assistance.”

His brow furrows, his small eyes nearly disappearing under his eyebrows. “We don’t need assistance, why… Why would we need assistance? You must have the wrong colony. Please leave.”

The two burly men, shift their feet, hands gripping their weapons more tightly. Zam steps forward, putting herself in front of Snow. Shifty eyes and the two brutes look healthy enough to Bopha. Bopha wouldn’t complain about getting out of this suit early. Plague jobs take too long, and there is always some asshole who tries to escape with their shuttle, as if they can outrun a virus already swimming through their veins. It’s practically tradition at this point. That’s why he got Manu to booby trap it with several redundant dead switches.

“We received a call for help from a colonist here. He said there was a pandemic.” 
His eyebrow twitches at that, “Who?”

Snow hesitates, obviously, this isn’t the welcome she was expecting. Probably thought there would be people throwing themselves at her feet, begging for her to save them. Bopha scoffs at the idea.

“He didn’t give us a name.”

“Was he young? Scar over his eyebrow?” The man draws a line from the top of his forehead down to the right.

“Yes, I believe so.”

The burly men look at each other. Pudgy cheeks smiles, and it is just about as discomfiting as you would expect, “Well, that explains it. He’s a known prankster. It’s really becoming a problem. I’m so sorry for you wasting your time coming here.”

Bopha’s sensing that this colony is as fucked up as all the others. They always start with some kind of utopian idea, but end up being run by some greedy pig and some muscle. This place checks all those boxes. His guess is that their contact wasn’t supposed to call anyone, and now he’s buried out in the desert somewhere. Or worse, thrown to some of the spectacularly terrifying creatures that live around here. This is a good time to bail, before they meet the same fate.

Bopha steps forward and tugs at Snow’s arm. She shakes him off. “He didn’t seem like he was joking.”

The man’s smile vanishes, “I’m sorry you wasted your time, but our colony is fine.”

“You heard the man Snow, everything’s good here. Let’s head back.” Arooj got the hint, backing away slowly.

“No, not until I’ve met this supposed ‘prankster’ and heard his side of the story.”

Bopha curses under his breath. What the hell is she thinking? They don’t want the help. Call it a day.

The man blinks repeatedly, sweat trickling down into his eyes. He looks at the gun in Zam’s arms, and those on his and Arooj’s belts. He probably thinks they’re pirates, here to raid the colony. By the looks of their generic printed clothes, they’ve not got much to steal. It’s obvious he doesn’t want to let them in, but he’s not got much choice. It’s not like his backup is going to do much damage with a pickaxe and some beat up plasma axe. “Fine, follow me.”

The burly men look at each other surprised and relieved, dropping their weapons, keeping a good grip on them. Snow and Zam follow the man into the caves, the burly men nod for Bopha and Arooj to follow. Bopha sure as hell doesn’t want to walk into whatever the hell is happening here, but Snow pays the bills, so he’s not got much choice. He nods to Arooj, flashing a sign with his hand. She nods back, getting the message. Be ready. They walk into the cave, the two burly men behind them.

The caves are blissfully cool compared to the outside. It’s almost worth risking his life just for a little AC. The caves are mostly naturally forming, with smooth streaked walls of varying browns and the occasional rust coloured red. In some areas, the cave’s been chiseled to make it easier to walk through.

“How many people live in the colony?” Snow asks the man.

“Just over a 100.” The man’s pace is quick, Bopha and the other’s hustling to keep up.

“And when was it established?” Bopha rolls his eyes at Snow. This isn’t a travel tour.

“8 years ago.”

They take turn after turn, Bopha losing track of their way out. Good things, his Q has been recording it the whole time. A quick exit is likely going to be useful. The tunnel opens up into a chamber. Work lights connected by cables give off an orange glow. A ladder leads down into a bigger chamber below. “The colony is down there. After you.”

Snow goes to clamber down, but Zam stops her, peering over the edge.

“Is there something wrong?” The man looks nervous.

“Why don’t you go down first?”

“Zam, please, we’re guests here.”

“My knees aren’t what they used to be.” The man apologises, forcing out a nervous smile.

“Okay then, how bout him?” Zam points to one of the burly men. He looks terrified. But the man in charge says, “Of course, go down Marcel. Show them the way.”

The man shakes his head.

“Marcel. Do as I say.”

He backs away shaking his head. Zam raises her carbine. But before Bopha can snatch the pistol from his hip, the lights of the chamber pop with an electrical burst. A second later Bopha’s head splits with intense pain, his visual interface going dark after a multicolour explosion. The next thing he feels is a shove, then floating for far too long in the air before smashing into the ground.

Pain washes over him, pulsing from his left side. Thankfully, he didn’t land on his pistol. Instincts kicking in, he draws it and points it to what he guesses is where the man was. But it’s pitch black in the cave, and without his interface, he can’t enhance his vision.

“Arooj, you okay?” Bopha calls out.

“Twisted my fucking ankle.” Arooj replies from somewhere to the right. She sounds more pissed than hurt, “I’m going to rip them apart when I get a hold of them.”

“Sounds like a plan.” Bopha scrambles up, shaking his limbs. Nothing feels broken, just bruised all to hell. “Snow, Zambaga. You down here?”

“Yes, we’re alright.”

“Anyone know what the fuck just happened?” Bopha shuffles forward, pistol still held out, as he gropes with his other hand for a wall, ladder, anything.

“Combat EMP.” Zambaga, 
“They didn’t have a gun between them, but they’re packing combat tech? What the hell is going on here?” Bopha’s hand touches the rough rock of a wall, he shuffles sideways, following hopefully to the ladder. If it’s still there.

“I don’t know, but he obviously didn’t want us finding out.” Snow’s voice comes from further down the cave.

“Zambaga, are your augments still working?”

“My eyes and ears are fried, but my threads are shielded and still working.”

“Punching rocks isn’t going to make it any lighter here. Anyone have an idea?”

“Working on it.” Arooj, still seated by the sounds of it. Bopha hears a crack, and then a quick woosh, as if something just sucked up a bunch of air. A dribble of something pouring over it and suddenly the chamber starts to glow green.

Bopha can just make out Arooj, sitting awkwardly on the ground, next to a mound of green glowing moss. Snow and Zambaga are on the other side of the cave, doing the same as him, touching the walls of the cave, looking for a way out.

“How did you do that?” Snow asks.

“Breaker’s Beard reacts to alcohol.”

“Clever,” Zam says.

Bopha looks around, trying to find where they fell from. A dark spot up to his right. There’s no ladder. They must have taken it. “Any chance you got a grapple hook for a hand Zambaga?”

“No, but I’m thinking I should get one.”

“Maybe there’s another way out? The caves on Fornax rarely have dead ends.”

“Someone’s coming.” Arooj points her pistol up at the ledge. Bopha doesn’t hear anything, but he trusts Arooj’s gened ears. He points his pistol as well, backing up to get a better angle. A white light fills the ledge, as well as a voice and the sound of shuffling feet.

“Stop. Please. Where are you taking me? Yuri, I didn’t–” The voice turns to a shout as it's thrown off the side of the ledge, landing without a thud. The white light disappears quickly. Snow rushes over to the moaning figure, rolling him over. Bopha keeps his pistol aimed at him.

His features are difficult to make out in the low light, but it doesn’t take long to figure out that this is their contact. The young man with the scar on his face.

“Get off me!” He pushes Snow off, and scuttles backwards, stopping against the cave wall. “Please, don’t hurt me.”

“We’re not going to hurt you. My name is Snow. I’m with the Intergalactic Rescue Agency. You called us for help.”

His face changes, as he looks from Snow to the rest of the crew.

“Then why are you down here?”

“Your chief didn’t exactly throw out the red carpet.” Bopha walks over to Arooj, checking on her ankle. She swats his hand away, busily constructing a makeshift brace, pointing at her tool kit, a few feet away. He walks over to grab it. 
“But why would he do that? Did you tell him your help was free? I know we can’t afford help, but why turn it away if it’s given?”

“Whatever is going, I promise you, we will get to the bottom of it. But first, are you hurt?” Snow asks,

“No, I mean yes, but nothing too bad.”

“Good, what’s your name?”

“Daeshim.”

“Nice to meet you. That’s Zambaga, Bopha and Arooj.”

His eyes widen at the sight of Arooj. He’s probably never seen a Khadiriian before.

“Hi.” He says meekly.

Bopha hands Arook the tool kit. She opens it and pulls out an injector. “We’re going to need a sample.” Bopha nods, taking the injector and walking over to Daeshim.

“Do you mind?” Bopha places the injector against his arm, not waiting for a reply.

“No go ahe–” He grimaces as the injector takes a sample of blood.  
Snow shoots Bopha a stern glance. He shrugs and takes the sample over to Arooj. 
Snow continues her questioning, “Can you tell us more about this sickness? How did it start?”

“It was about three weeks ago. One of the kids got sick. Usual symptoms. Coughing, running nose. We thought nothing of it, just another cold. It came on fast and quickly spread to some other kids, each with the same kinds of symptoms. A few hours after they were infected, the coughing subsided, just like that. Quickest cold we’d ever seen. But then strange things starting happening.”

“Strange how?”

“One of the kids fell down and scraped his knee real bad. He yelled out in pain, and seconds later, all the other infected kids did the same. As if they all had felt the pain themselves.”

“How is that possible?” Bopha helps Arooj input the sample into her portable sequencer. Thankfully, unaffected by the emp and the fall.

Snow turns to Arooj, “Arooj, have you heard of anything like that before?”

“No. Closest thing I can think of is a pseudo-virus on Rahim that infects herds of Frogelk. Tricks them into thinking the other members of the herd they see are just reflections of itself. So if it sees another Frogelk hurt, it thinks that it’s actually seeing itself hurt.”

“Were the kids looking at the kid that got hurt?”

“Some, but others no. They were in another classroom.”

“What else happened?”

“After that, it spread through the colony and things got worse. One of the kids got upset that she couldn’t play with a toy that another kid had. She threw a tantrum.”

“Let me guess, all the kids did the same.”

“Worse than that. It’s like it amplified it. They were out of control. Like feral animals, clawing and biting at each other and the teachers. Some of the adults, the first ones to be infected, got mad out of nowhere, one second they were fine, the next they were breaking things and attacking others. And they were nowhere near the school, across the colony. After that we’ve been held up in our houses, hoping that if we stay away from each other, we might prevent the next occurrence.”

“Did it work?”

“No, as more of us got infected, the events kept happening more frequently. Sometimes, you would be hit with a wave of sadness, other times, incredible joy. It’s like our strong emotions spread like wildfire.”

“But otherwise, there are no other symptoms?”

“None.”

“You’re chief didn’t look infected, neither did his goons. Any idea why?” Bopha  
“I don’t know. I’ve been holed up in my house for the last two days. I only saw Yuri a few minutes ago, when they came to get me.”

“And he wasn’t wearing any kind of protection, so likely not airborne then.” Arooj grimaces as she tightens her makeshift brace. She pulls herself up and shuffles back to lean against the wall of the cave.

“The combat EMP implies corporate interests.” Zam checks over her carbine, looking like she’s ready to kill.

“How was the colony doing before the infections started?” Snow’s focus is still squarely on Daeshim.

“What do you mean?”

“Any strangers come to visit?”

“No, just the regular traders that make the rounds between the colonies.”

“How does the colony make money?”

“Is this really relevant?” Bopha, impatient to get out of this death trap.

Snow shoots him a cold stare. Bopha shakes his head and scoops a little bit of the algae to go explore the other end of the cave.

“We mine some rare metals deeper in the caves. Or at least we did.”

“How so?”

“Well we’ve emptied out our main deposit, and the new ones we’ve found have been of poor quality.”

Snow nods, looking over at Zam, “Corporate.”

Zam nods.

“Are you saying someone did this to us?” Horror mixed with anger blooms on Daeshim’s face.

“It’s a possibility. One we will investigate and get to the bottom of. I promise you Daeshim. We will help.” Snow touches him on the shoulder, the gesture calming some of his jitteriness.

Bopha reaches the other end of the cave, finding an opening heading down a narrow tunnel. “Any idea where this leads?”

Daeshim shakes his head, “No, I don’t recognize this chamber.”

“Arooj, anything from the sample?”

“Well my gear’s all fried so no. We’d need to get back to the shuttle.”

“If they haven’t stolen it yet. Every fucking time–”

Suddenly, a series of loud metallic clinks echo up from the tunnel, like a wind chime thrashing in a storm. 
“Oh no. No, no, no.” Daeshim turns and runs towards the ledge where they were thrown down, desperately grabbing the rock, trying to climb up.

“That’s not good,” Bopha rubs the algae onto the top of the pistol, “How do I know if this gun still works.”

“It’s mechanical, it’ll work.” Zam appears at his side, the carbine pointing down the tunnel. “Sharkworms hunt by vibration. Stay very still. Aim for the mouth.”

“Never seen one before, but aren’t they all mouth?”

“Well then it should be easy for you to hit it.”

Bopha takes a deep breath, the metallic clinks nearing, now accompanied by fleshy thuds. It must be enormous. Why the hell do people live here? No ravenous worms in space. Much safer.

Bopha’s eyes strain with the dim light of the algae, spotting a glimmer, and then another and another, closing in fast. The fleshy thuds are thunderous. Bopha takes a step back, Zam holds her ground, not looking the least bit terrified. Bopha would like to steal some of that.

The Sharkworm’s maw opens and suddenly the light bounces off endless rings of spear like teeth. Bopha pulls the trigger, but nothing happens. Fuck, jammed. Zam fires three rapid shots from her carbine, landing in a perfect group on the fleshy inside of the mouth. The worm thrashes, closing its mouth, but doesn’t slow down, barreling out of the tunnel. Bopha and Zam leap out of the way, barely avoiding the barreling creature.

He scrambles up onto his feet, smacking the gun, willing it to fucking work. He watches as the worm heads straight for the hysterically yelling Daeshim, who’s miraculously managed to get a few feet up the ledge. Zam continues to fire shots into the flank of the beast, but it doesn’t even register them. The worm reaches the other end of the cavern in seconds, its immense maw aiming to swallow Daeshim. Snow claps her hands and throws a rock at it. It slows and turns towards her. Zam leaps into the air and strikes the side of the worm with all her threaded strength, her fist disappearing into its purple flesh. The Sharkworm doesn’t like that one bit, snapping its head back, smacking Snow to the ground. “Snow!” Zam yells, ripping her arm free from the body of the worm and gracefully side stepping away from his angry thrashing, scooping up Snow with one arm, leaping out of the way.

Bopha edges towards Arooj, who is busy building some kind of device. Sweat dripping from her brow. Daeshim slips and falls, hitting the ground with a thud. The worm, attracted to the sound, rushes onto him, swallowing his wiggling legs. Daeshim screams in pain, as the worm teeth drag him deeper into its mouth.

“Shoot it goddamn it! Use the pistols!” Snow yells.

Bopha points and pulls the trigger, the pistol still jammed.

“Goddman it,” He smashes the pistol against the cave wall and points it again, firing three shots, two against the worm hide, the other into the mouth. It expands immediately, but not enough to stop the grim work of the those teeth.

Daeshim’s screams are just whimpers now, as his heads disappears into the mouth. Arooj stands up next to him, hobbling towards the creature.

“Hey, look at me!” She bellows.

The creature spins about, Daeshim’s limp body flicking about inside of it.

“I’m sorry.” She throws whatever the hell she was building into its mouth.

“Everybody duck!” She drops to the ground and Bopha turns as the worm’s head explodes, a thundering boom, echoing back and forth in the chamber, launching Bopha against the cave wall, shattering his helmet, and covering everything in red and purple blood.

Bopha rolls over and sits up, his heart racing, gulping deep ragged breaths. His hands are shaking, but he dares not loosen the grip on the pistol. Holding it like a talisman against evil. He looks over at the dead body of the worm, still twitching in a loose coil. He blinks, something dripping into his eye. He wipes his forehead with the back of his gloves hand, regretting it immediately as it yanks out some shards of plastic.

“You okay Captain?” Arooj is breathing heavily as well.

“No. I want to get the fuck out of here. You okay?”

“Barely.”

“What the fuck was that?”

“A bomb.”

“No shit.”

“What the hell were you thinking,” Snow stomps over, her suit torn and hanging in ragged chunks, drenched in blood.

“I saved our lives, you’re welcome.” Arooj spits back defiantly.

“You killed him!” Her eyes watering, emotion spilling over.

“He was already dead.”

“You don’t know that!”

“Snow. She’s right.” Zam places a tender hand on Snow’s shoulder, very much not like a bodyguard would. More like a family.

Snow tries to swat the hand away, “No! No!”

Zam pulls her into a hug, and Snow collapses into it, shoulder bobbing as she sobs quietly. What the hell is their thing? Lovers?

“Captain.”

“Yeah, what is it Arooj?”

“Your suit.”

Bopha looks down at his arm to check his suit readout, wiping the blood off it. It flashes red, suit seal compromised.

“Good thing it’s not airborne right?” 
Arooj’s concerned face shatters that illusion, “Daeshim was in there too.”

“Fuck,” Bopha spits out the blood in his mouth.

Arooj is already next to him, disinfectant spray in hand, wiping and spraying his entire face. She forces him to keep his eyes open and she sprays there too, burning and stinging in equal terrible measure.

“Fuck me that hurts.”

She steps back, looking him over. Apparently satisfied, she turns to Zam and Snow. “And your suits?”

Zam gently unfolds her arms and checks her readout, “Green.”

Snow looks down at hers, and slowly shakes her head, showing the red readout. Zam’s eyes widen and Bopha wouldn’t have imagined it were possible, but she looks afraid, terrified.

“Spray her!” She demands of Arooj.

Arooj pulls out another can and does the same to Snow. Her helmet was intact, so she didn’t have to get that horrible taste stuck in her mouth.

Bopha, having worked a few plague jobs before, knows that if the virus, or whatever the hell it is already in his blood, the stinging eyes were for nothing.

“We need to get back to the shuttle and up to the ship. I can work faster with my full lab.”

“Yeah, fuck this place.” Bopha looks at the dead worm carcass,

“We are not leaving.” Snow’s voice is steady, the sobbing from earlier erased. Her eyes are ablaze now. “We are going to put a stop to this.”

“Are you fucking serious? We’re likely infected ourselves. I’m not going to go to war just to please your saviour complex. We’re heading back to the ship, and that’s an order.”

“He’s right Snow, we need to get you back,” Zam agrees.

“You can go back without me. I signed the stupid waiver didn’t I? Go save yourselves.” Snow brushes off Zam’s hand and marches towards the ledge, the coiled worm carcass pressed up against it. She clambers up onto it, the ledge another eight feet above her. She turns around, “Zam, give me a lift.”

Zam takes a deep breath in, but obeys, leaping gracefully up onto the carcass and hoisting Snow up.

“Wait for us.” Bopha and Arooj stumble over there, Zam helping to lift up Arooj, which Bopha was infinitely thankful for. Arooj’s bones were gened for high gravity, and he’s not exactly a big guy to begin with.

Zam is the last one to climb up, Bopha and Arooj helping her up.

“Where’s Snow?” They turn around and see that she’s gone.

“Snow!” Zam rushes down the corridor after her.

Arooj and Bopha look at each other, “Back to the ship?”

“Back to the ship.”

They take it slowly, with their Qs fried, they’re taking best guesses as to the way out, Arooj’s superior sense of smell hopefully leading them to the exit. After a few dozen meters of dark tunnels, they hit a lit one. Must be out of the radius of the EMP now. They look left and right. Both directions seem exactly the same.

“Which way?”

“Right smells fresher.”

“Good enough.”

They continue walking down the tunnel, taking a few turns and eventually hearing voice ahead. They slow down.

“Is it Snow?”

Arooj’s eyes are closed, her ears twitching, “No, doesn’t sound like the asshole who led us in either.”

“Shit, we’re never going to find our way out of here on our own.” Bopha checks his pistol. Two rounds left.

“How’s yours?”

“Used most of the rounds for lighting. Only got the one left.”

“Well, let’s make em count.”

They inch around the corner of the tunnel, seeing natural light up ahead. Not to the outside, but to a larger chamber. Two big guys guard the entrance, both holding rifles. Bopha aims his pistol and gives a quick nod to Arooj. But before they fire, the two men drop to the ground like puppets with their strings cut. Out of another side tunnel, Zam appears, carbine nestled in her shoulder. Snow in tow.

“What are they planning on doing? Taking down the whole colony?”

Bopha and Arooj hobble over to them, nearly getting shot, as Zam spins around to point the gun at them. “It’s us.”

She lowers the carbine, but Snow’s eyes look ready to punch holes through them anyway.

“Thanks for running off.”

“Figured you’d be off planet already, saving your own hide.”

“Believe me, I would, if I had any clue how to get out of here.”

Bopha kneels down and picks up one of the rifles, but Snow stops him, “No. No lethal weaponry.”

“We were very nearly lunch back there, and your friend’s lovey dovey bullets didn’t do shit all, so I’m taking the rifle, he yanks it out of her grip.”

“You are insufferable,” Her face is flushed, fist balled up like when they first met.

Bopha’s mind ready to shoot back with a sharp quip, but something washes over him. So difficult to describe. A flush of anger washes over him, so intense that all he wants to do is scratch and claw at the nearest person. He lifts the rifle and points it at Snow, his face contorted. And then, in an instant, he’s on the ground, Zam yanking his arm, knee in his back. The pain is intense. Snow yells out in pain. Zam loosens her grip, enough for Bopha to squirm away. 
“What happened Snow?”

“I just felt pain. In my arm and my back. And then it was gone.”

Bopha looks at Arooj, “I think it’s happening. I felt anger, like it wasn’t mine. It just took over.”

His skin prickles, the idea of some unknown pathogen swimming through his veins, doing god knows what to his insides, chilling his blood.

Snow visibly shivers, her eyes widening in horror.

“What was that?” She says.

“You felt it too?”

“I was afraid, but I don’t know why, and then it went away.”

“We need to get to the lab. Fast, before the virus spreads too far.” Arooj hurries them forward.

“We have to help these people.”

“Snow, we can only do that with a cure. And for that I need my equipment from the shuttle.”

“Fine.”

“How are we going to find our way there?”

“This one will do.” Zam kneels down next one of the goons, pulling out a little tool from her belt and adjusting something on the circular dart clamped onto his neck. The man wakes up, “Who are you?” He looks down at his body, “Why can’t I feel my arms, my legs. What did you do to me?”

“If you behave and show us the way out of here, I’ll give you back your arms and legs. Otherwise, there’s a hungry worm down in the tunnels…”

“Yes, I’ll show you. Anything, please.”

“Good boy.” Zam lifts and throws him over her shoulder like he weighs nothing. “Lead the way.”

## Chapter 10

They exit the cave system, the hot air smacking into them. Their shuttle is still there, but there’s an asshole taking a plasma axe to the hull.

“Hey asshole, hands off my shuttle.” Bopha rushes towards him, Snow hot on his heels, mimicking his anger, yelling her own curses.

Zam drops their semi-paralyzed guide to the ground with a thump, shouldering her carbine and dropping the vandal just as he turns around.



I still want to get to the riot? How does Arooj inoculate the whole community.
